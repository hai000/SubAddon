184
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:11,976
[Dementus] Now, you have had
a hard day, haven't you?

185
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,169
An awful day.

186
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,370
You must be exhausted.

187
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,907
There's only one thing I need
you to do and that is rest.

188
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:22,751
You don't have to
tell us anything.

189
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,745
You don't have to say a word,
I promise.

190
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,149
Just rest.

191
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,477
Tomorrow, I'll take you home.

192
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:31,590
I'll follow the tracks
that brought you here

193
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,123
and I'll take you home.

194
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,754
Take her, feed her, wash her.

195
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,998
Use our best drinking water.

196
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,199
You two.

197
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:46,697
Keep an eye on her,
keep her safe.

198
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:48,600
Don't let any
of these brutes near her.

- Shoot!

217
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:34,799
[woman] It's not my fault.

218

[Furiosa]
How are they tracking us?

229
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,304
Ride to high ground.
Hide yourself well.

230
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,999
If I don't find you in one day,
go home.

231
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:17,307
Ma, I...

232
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,751
Take your bearings
from the sun and stars.

233

When there is wind,
use it to cover your tracks.

- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Furiosa!

235

you'll find your way home.

She's your mother. Perfect.

00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:41,248
Tell me!

[Furiosa] Ma!

264
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:46,451
Tell me where you came from
and we will cease and desist.

- All you have to do...

267

All you have to do
is just point.

268
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:57,028
Point me in the right direction
and I'll take you home.

269
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:00,262
No, no, no. Don't look away.

270
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,471
We mustn't look away.

271
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,541

You had your chance.

The secretions of the lacrimal
gland containing oils,

276
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,916
salts, proteins,
and stress hormones.

277
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,489
The tears of joy
and those of sorrow

278
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,250
have different
chemical compositions.

279
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:24,858
Yes. Sorrow is more...

280
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,861
piquant, zesty.

[Dementus] Why would you
run from me?

285

[groans]

286
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,212
Now your followers must fight
over who gets to kill you.

287
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:24,842
Now, I would've welcomed you.
Every one.

288
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,216
I woulda brought you in.

289
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,592
You coulda been a part
of this great horde.

290
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:32,061
Now, we have a problem.

291
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,226
There are 20 of you,
but only five bikes.

292
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,261
How do we choose?

293
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,995
Who's got the goods,
the bollocks, the testes

294
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,804
to ride with Dementus?

295
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:46,137
You're gonna have to show me
who you are.

296
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:50,744
Yes?

297
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,979
Because today
we dance to Darwin.

298
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:59,221
Today, we do
The Five Bike Teddy.

299
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:03,022
Ready, setty, go!

[grunts]

303
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:30,437
You don't have to watch
if you don't want to.

304
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:33,283
You may wanna close your eyes.

305
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,929
You know,
you could hold this if you want.

306
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:46,629
It belonged to my little ones.

307
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,464
Why don't you
just keep him safe?

308
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:04,815

start your engines.

[engines rumbling]

313
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,760
Can you write?

314
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:22,191
I can teach you.
Muscle up your memory.

315
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,833
You could become a History Man.

316
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,875
Make yourself invaluable,

317
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:36,076
and Dementus
will look after you.

318
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:23,052

Red! Red!

322
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,014
Are we curious, boss?

323
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,410
Well, let's go have a look.

324
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:08,465
[War Boy] Is this Halvalla?

325
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,401
Am I in Valhalla?

326
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:12,170
What's Valhalla?

327
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:14,401
Valhalla's
"The Hall of the Slain."

328
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:16,411
A paradise for dead heroes.

329
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:17,606
Good for you.

330
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,261
We're looking for a place
of abundance.

331
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,108
What's abundance?

332
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:23,821
Abundance, plentifulness.

333
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,824
Having a copious quantity
of something.

334
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,189
[War Boy] Co...
What's "copus quantity"?

335
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:33,056
A lotta stuff.
A lotta good stuff.

336
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,191
[War Boy] The Citadel.

337
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:35,298

[War Boy]
It's where I was birthed.

339

A humongous amount
of fresh water.

341
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:42,237
And green stuff.

Mountains of pro-juice
and veggies and... and water.

343
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,045
And where would one
find this Citadel?

344
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,448
That way maybe.

345
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,583
What are these?

346
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,811
That is sky blood.
It called you to me.

00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,330
A very attractive choice.

363
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:26,965
I want your leaders.

364
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:28,500
[scattered cheering]

365
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:32,242
I want those
who hold dominance over you.

366
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,510
Bring me your leaders
and throw them down.

367
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,681
Throw them down,
and you'll avoid

368
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,243
more suffering and sorrow.

369
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,384
They exploit you.
They enslave you.

370
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,220
They wash their feet
in your sweat and blood

371
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:50,186
and they give you
nothing in return.

372
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,696
[cheering and laughter]

373
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,154
[Dementus] Listen to this truth.

374
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,636
Big shots rule only
because you choose to follow.

375
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,670
The power is with you.

376
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,067
You are free to choose.

377
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:06,042
Come to me.

378
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,712
Come to me
with your pain and burden,

379
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,840
and I will double your grub.

380
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:14,046
Food and water for everyone,
as much you like.

381
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,142
We will share the wealth.

382
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:20,656
You will rule with me in
the splendor of a new Wasteland.

383
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,653
[bikers cheering]

384
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:36,068
Adorable.

385
00:34:36,202 --> 00:34:39,141
[laughter, jeers]

386
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,741
I'm afraid for you, sweetheart.
Really afraid.

387
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:46,576
'Cause Big Jilly here is gonna
scoop you out, both ends,

388
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,812
mush it up
and feed it back to you.

389
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:51,546
But that ain't nothing compared
to what Mr. Norton here

390
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,320
is dreaming of doing to you.

391
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:56,126
'Cause Mr. Norton
really hates big shots.

392
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,289
- Then there's Mr. Harley.
- G'day, mate!

393
00:34:58,424 --> 00:35:01,297
Mr. Davidson, Rizzdale Pell

394
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,959
and a thousand other
mad bastards coming after you,

395
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:08,061
and there ain't nothing
I can do to stop 'em.

396
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:18,973
The Immortan has a request.

397
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,816
Among all his warriors
assembled here,

398
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:24,451
choose one.

399
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,888
Why would I do that?

400
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,386
For this negotiation
to go further,

401
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:33,521
you must choose at random.

402
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:36,298
Any War Boy. Just one.

403
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:40,029
What if I choose not to choose?

404
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:43,030
Then you'll never know
the truth.

405
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,500
My Smeg will choose.

406
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:50,543
Yes! [giggling]

407
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:55,311
Okay.

408
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,634
[Smeg] Nope. To the right.

409
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:29,681
[can clatters]

410
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,763
You are awaited.

411
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,937
Witness me!

412
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:52,165
[War Boys] Witness!

413
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:01,746
[War Boys] Immorta!

414
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:07,720
Among us
are 972 devout warriors.

415
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:12,152
Any one of them, if chosen,
would've done the same.

416
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:17,493
Each would die historic
for the Immortan Joe.

417
00:37:18,229 --> 00:37:20,696
- That's why you're fools.
- [biker] You're the fool!

418
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:23,732
You're all fools
for coming here.

419
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,100
[Immortan Joe breathing deeply]

420
00:37:30,574 --> 00:37:33,943
I am Scrotus.

421
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,649
I am Rictus.

422
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:42,325
We are the sons
of the Immortan Joe.

423
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:47,055
And now we're going to kill you.

424
00:37:48,295 --> 00:37:50,058
[all yelling]

425
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:04,578
[biker yelling]

426
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,427
[grunting]

427
00:38:24,197 --> 00:38:25,197
Hey!

428
00:38:33,374 --> 00:38:35,004
[Furiosa straining]

429
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:45,784
- [flies buzzing]
- [grunting with effort]

430
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:54,194
I gotcha.

431
00:39:01,468 --> 00:39:03,835
[explosions booming]

432
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,362
[Dementus] <i>When things
go bonkers, you have to adapt.</i>

433
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:29,997
- You, same as me.
- [puppy whines]

434
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,133
They're here.

435
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:33,568
We're tough.

436
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,998
- You're a tender little hound.
- [whimpering]

437
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:39,106
[Mr. Harley]
A War Rig. Fully loaded.

438
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,453
[The Octoboss] It's from
the Citadel, all right.

439
00:39:41,477 --> 00:39:43,545
It's got the Immortan's mark.

440
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:54,754
Food and water for guzzolene.

441
00:39:56,754 --> 00:39:58,593
It beats scavenging.

442
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:02,388
This is our destiny.

443
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:05,028
We are indeed
in the land of opportunity.

444
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,537
[engines rumbling faintly]

445
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,299
[men shouting in distance]

446
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:55,518
[faint gunfire]

447
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,502
Watch this.

448
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,418
[biker] All hail Dementus!

449
00:41:33,553 --> 00:41:36,086
[bikers] Dementus!

450
00:41:37,823 --> 00:41:40,756
Fuel for all, enough for months.

451
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:43,292
Thisis truly a great day.

452
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:45,931
Yeah, well, I'm about to make it
a whole lot greater.

453
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:48,538
Who are you?
Remove your helmet and jacket.

454
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,832
I take orders from The Octoboss.

455
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:53,967
[Dementus] Huh?

456
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,511
Yeah, do what he says.

457
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:03,014
[Dementus] Uh-uh...
Questioning my boss-ority.

458
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:10,989
[groans] Okay.

459
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:15,356
All right, that's good.

460
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:18,799
Right. Go on.

461
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:21,065
Cover yourself in this.

462
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:25,207
That's it.

463
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:27,808
Come on. Come on.

464
00:42:30,476 --> 00:42:31,476
Good?

465
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:34,045
There ya go.

466
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,511
Choose ten of your men.
The balder the better.

467
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,224
Mortifiers.

468
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,424
[Dementus] Settle down.

469
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,519
Who wants to be a War Boy?

470
00:42:58,099 --> 00:42:59,972
[line ringing]

471
00:43:05,514 --> 00:43:07,309
[bell ringing weakly]

472
00:43:11,454 --> 00:43:13,282
[ringing continues]

473
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:30,470
What?

474
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:33,045
[watchman] <i>The rig's coming back.
I think they're under attack.</i>

475
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:54,697
Do we open the gates?

476
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:57,458
No. Something's off.

477
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,634
I'm gonna have to slow down.

478
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:05,098
No. Faster. Go faster.

479
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:06,440
They won't open the gate.

480
00:44:06,575 --> 00:44:07,941
They're not buying it.

481
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:15,141
Shoot them.

482
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:16,283
[biker] What?

483
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:17,445
Make it real.

484
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:20,656
[biker 2] What'd he say?

485
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,615
[biker 2] He wants us
to make it real.

486
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,293
[The Octoboss]
What are you doing?

487
00:44:28,429 --> 00:44:29,429
[yells]

488
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:33,199
[rider] No, no. No, no, no!

489
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:37,168
You're scum, Dementus. Scum!

490
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,975
Open the gates.

491
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:43,878
Open the gates!

492
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:52,612
[horn blaring]

493
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:34,559
[gunshots]

494
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:35,930
Open the gates.

495
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,263
[bikers yelling]

496
00:45:59,116 --> 00:46:01,153
[overlapping chatter]

497
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:04,954
[man] Back off.

498
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:06,626
[man 2] Get off.

499
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:10,767
[Smeg]
Give this to Immortan Joe.

500
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:12,961
Catch.

501
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,302
Dementus wants to talk.

502
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,146
[man] Are you sure?

503
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:31,249
[Immortan Joe]
Yes. Let him come.

504
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,820
Body search, no weapons.

505
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:37,558
Whatever he wants, we'll listen.

506
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,159
Then kill him on the spot.

507
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:46,099
[respirator hissing]

508
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:56,711
[Rizzdale] Calm down.

509
00:46:57,744 --> 00:46:58,744
Calm down.

510
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,517
The Red Dementus commends you
on your lifestyle

511
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:11,454
and for agreeing to these
trade negotiations.

512
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:19,731
If we're not back safe
by sunset,

513
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:21,068
we blow up Gastown.

514
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,976
This is how you save Gastown.

515
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:32,882
[keys clicking]

516
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,481
[grunts softly]

517
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:45,224
And the six-figure code exists
only in the brain of Dementus.

518
00:47:49,363 --> 00:47:51,891
He wants double.
Double of everything.

519
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:54,361
One full tank of water
for half a tank of guzzolene.

520
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,198
Can't do that. Not possible.

521
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,006
Then he gets a spike in the nut.

522
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,872
Double the mothers' milk
and double the hydroponics.

523
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:03,737
[man] Double the spuds.

524
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:05,915
Double the maggot mash
and the roach gruel.

525
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,106
My boys need all the protein
they can get.

526
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:09,410
[yelps]

527
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:12,581
Please. Give him what he wants!

528
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:16,420
The Wasteland won't sustain it.
Run the numbers.

529
00:48:18,157 --> 00:48:20,692
Please, my Immortan. My brother.

530
00:48:20,827 --> 00:48:23,130
[breath hissing]

531
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,635
[Dementus] Make up your mind.

532
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:27,596
Can't hold this much longer.

533
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,797
Let Rictus do it, Dad.

534
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,512
I'll squeeze
the code out of him.

535
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,044
- Here, take it. Take it.
- Huh?

536
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,705
- [pained grunt]
- [groans]

537
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:42,710
Oh, you idiot.

538
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:45,778
I've forgotten the numbers.

539
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:47,324
- [Dementus] Wait, wait, wait.
- [yells]

540
00:48:47,348 --> 00:48:49,718
Wait! [groaning]

541
00:48:49,854 --> 00:48:52,621
Yep, it's in there,
got it, got it, got it, okay.

542
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:54,690
[groans, shivers]

543
00:48:54,825 --> 00:48:57,031
The pleasure flushed them
clean out of my head.

544
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,372
Don't ever do that again, comrades.

545
00:48:58,396 --> 00:48:59,936
I'm a man with a fragile brain.

546
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:03,869
Who's that?

547
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:11,838
That... is my daughter,
Little D.

548
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,774
Little Dementus.

549
00:49:16,314 --> 00:49:17,813
She looks nothing like you.

550
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:19,590
[Dementus] Yes, well, she has
her mother's perfections,

551
00:49:19,614 --> 00:49:20,823
and none of my deficiencies.

552
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,278
[Immortan Joe]
Where's the mother?

553
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:25,359
[sighs] Magnificent woman.
Fierce, intelligent.

554
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,430
Taken so cruelly protecting
this little one from marauders.

555
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:29,988
She looks pale.

556
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:33,432
You look pale. She's perfect.

557
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:35,602
Not like the genetic absurdities
you have for sons.

558
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:37,171
[growls quietly]

559
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:40,305
Well, she's pale
because I take her blood,

560
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:42,774
for blood pudding
that I prepare for him.

561
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:44,343
And who are you?

562
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:49,150
Well, I'm the Organic Mechanic.
All things therapeutic.

563
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:52,754
Now, make no mistake,
she is a full-life.

564
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,783
Untouched by man or disease.

565
00:49:56,891 --> 00:49:58,995
[breathes heavily]

566
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,953
Would you like to stay here
in the Citadel?

567
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:02,465
Eh?

568
00:50:03,498 --> 00:50:05,143
[Immortan Joe]
If I let you stay and you grow

569
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,528
to become a strong,
healthy woman,

570
00:50:06,664 --> 00:50:08,467
you could become
one of our wives.

571
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:10,532
No, she's my daughter.

572
00:50:10,668 --> 00:50:12,839
It will be
a royal intermarriage.

573
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:14,371
The bonding of dynasties.

574
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:16,474
Her whole life
I have protected her,

575
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:18,348
from the sun, the wind,
every lecherous gaze.

576
00:50:18,372 --> 00:50:19,372
No.

577
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:22,082
You'll be bonded by blood.

578
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:23,976
No! She's not for sale,
she's mine.

579
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,682
What say you, child?

580
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:30,052
She hasn't spoken
since her mother's tragic end.

581
00:50:30,188 --> 00:50:31,489
Very poignant.

582
00:50:38,459 --> 00:50:40,366
[breath hissing]

583
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:44,205
Is he your father?

584
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,511
No.

585
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,878
He slaughtered my mother.

586
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:02,047
True, that is true.

587
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:03,915
And I can tell you
it made this child tough.

588
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:05,518
Tough enough
to survive all sorrows

589
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:06,661
that may come her way.

590
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,588
I did that for her.

591
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:10,066
[softer] I did that for her.

592
00:51:14,765 --> 00:51:17,199
I will increase
your shipment of water.

593
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:18,772
But only by a third.

594
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,367
I will increase your food
by a quarter.

595
00:51:21,503 --> 00:51:23,244
Potatoes only.

596
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:26,113
You'll get your delivery
once every ten days,

597
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,784
but only if my War Rigs
return safely

598
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,417
full of high-grade guzzolene.

599
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:35,052
Deal.

600
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:41,394
And... I will take this girl,
who is not your daughter.

601
00:51:42,425 --> 00:51:44,595
And also, him.

602
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:48,203
Otherwise, it's war.

603
00:51:59,675 --> 00:52:00,776
[Dementus whistles sharply]

604
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,364
[grunts]

605
00:52:30,177 --> 00:52:33,512
You behave, I'll behave.

606
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:35,678
I'll protect Gastown
from all treachery.

607
00:52:35,814 --> 00:52:38,846
It will be as impenetrable
as this Citadel.

608
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:41,920
Stability born
from a world of chaos.

609
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:44,655
You. Me. We.

610
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:52,366
Henceforth, I will be addressed
as "The Great Dementus."

611
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,204
Beloved ruler of Bikerdom.

612
00:52:56,138 --> 00:52:58,464
Lord Guardian of Gastown.

613
00:52:58,599 --> 00:52:59,968
[cackling]

614
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,541
Gotta go, gotta go.
Don't want Gastown to go boom.

615
00:53:03,643 --> 00:53:06,038
What a day.
What a deal. What a day.

616
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:07,880
[Rizzdale]
Beautifully played, boss.

617
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:10,780
- Peak Dementus! Eh? Eh?
- [men laughing]

618
00:53:18,894 --> 00:53:20,757
[bells jingling]

619
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,753
It's all right.
You'll be all right.

620
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,180
[Organic Mechanic] <i>All right.</i>

621
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:58,225
Now, shove that little beauty
out into the world.

622
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,044
- [woman breathing heavily]
- [Organic Mechanic] Come on.

623
00:54:00,068 --> 00:54:01,068
Here it comes.

624
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:03,338
I can see its head.

625
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,169
- [laughing]
- [heavy breathing continues]

626
00:54:05,305 --> 00:54:06,671
[woman yelling hoarsely]

627
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:09,102
[Organic Mechanic]
Good girl. Good girl.

628
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:13,507
- [bells jingling]
- [Organic Mechanic] Oh, yeah.

629
00:54:13,643 --> 00:54:15,310
You're very clever.

630
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:16,445
One last shove.

631
00:54:16,547 --> 00:54:18,946
[woman gasping, yelling]

632
00:54:19,082 --> 00:54:20,618
[Organic Mechanic]
One more, one more.

633
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:23,622
- [woman yelling, sobbing]
- Very good.

634
00:54:24,687 --> 00:54:26,653
[newborn baby crying]

635
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:28,957
Is it a boy? Is it a boy?

636
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:32,393
[baby shrieks]

637
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:34,336
More or less.

638
00:54:35,696 --> 00:54:37,229
Sorry, boss.

639
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,105
[woman]
I will give you a full-life!

640
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,409
I know that I can.

641
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,011
[Scrotus]
Three strikes, you're out.

642
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,644
- Rictus.
- [clap echoes]

643
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,951
[woman] Please, let me stay.

644
00:54:51,086 --> 00:54:52,746
Don't fret, love.

645
00:54:52,881 --> 00:54:55,291
You'll make an excellent milker.

646
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:12,165
[bells jingling softly]

647
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,727
[bells jingling]

648
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:50,445
[blade sawing at hair]

649
00:56:28,745 --> 00:56:29,847
[Rictus] What's this?

650
00:56:34,816 --> 00:56:36,458
[bells jingle]

651
00:56:43,758 --> 00:56:45,962
[jingling]

652
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:50,070
[grunts]

653
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:00,273
[bells jingling]

654
00:57:17,696 --> 00:57:20,764
Rictus. You lose something?

655
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,135
Just looking.
Just looking around.

656
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,299
What for?

657
00:57:24,435 --> 00:57:26,134
Nothing.

658
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:28,341
No. Don't lie to me.
You're up to something.

659
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:30,512
- What is it?
- Nothing.

660
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:33,343
Well, what're you
doing here then?

661
00:57:33,478 --> 00:57:34,615
[bells jingling]

662
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,293
[Rictus] I thought
I saw someone running.

663
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:37,578
Running away.

664
00:57:38,314 --> 00:57:40,819
But it was just a dream.
An annoying dream.

665
00:57:41,884 --> 00:57:43,925
[footsteps receding]

666
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,593
[growls softly]

667
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:50,422
[feet thudding]

668
00:57:51,464 --> 00:57:53,326
[breathing deeply]

669
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,104
- [wind blowing]
- [bells jingling faintly]

670
00:58:15,553 --> 00:58:17,416
[bells jingling]

671
00:58:28,863 --> 00:58:29,904
[man yells]

672
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,703
Brake!

673
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,203
Dogman. The loose cable!
Secure it!

674
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:44,014
[Scrotus] Save the bucket!
We need that bucket!

675
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,231
You go down.

676
00:58:58,366 --> 00:59:00,360
No. Someone small.

677
00:59:01,433 --> 00:59:02,538
You!

678
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:05,332
Come on.

679
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,040
No. Him.

680
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:25,825
[grunts softly]

681
00:59:48,008 --> 00:59:50,212
[metal creaking]

682
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,070
You've got a lot of ticker, boy.

683
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:14,874
Brake Man.

684
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,818
You're the new dogman.

685
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:52,945
[Rictus] Line up. Line up.

686
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:55,816
Juva-jub-jub.

687
01:00:58,282 --> 01:01:00,581
Welcome to the house
of holy motors.

688
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:03,654
We're gonna make us something
mighty from this boneyard,

689
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,124
from all these body parts.

690
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,955
Two hefty V8 engines,
a chassis for a Prime Mover,

691
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:11,766
2,857 found objects.

692
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,032
And we are going
to put this all together.

693
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,037
We are going to build
something beautiful.

694
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,836
And we're doing this for who?

695
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:21,436
- Immortan Joe.
- Who?

696
01:01:21,571 --> 01:01:23,710
Who will raise us
from the ashes of this world.

697
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,771
Are you ready
to be Black Thumbs?

698
01:01:25,907 --> 01:01:27,014
Immorta!

699
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:27,839
You?

700
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,150
Immorta!

701
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:30,444
How about you?

702
01:01:32,145 --> 01:01:33,486
Speak his name.

703
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:35,317
He don't speak. He's mute.

704
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:39,361
Where have I seen you before?

705
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,653
He's a dogman. Very useful.

706
01:01:42,957 --> 01:01:44,327
Scrawny.

707
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:46,924
Oi! We've got work to do.

708
01:01:47,794 --> 01:01:50,200
We're going to build ourselves
a War Rig.

709
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:53,099
The finest piece of grunt
in the Wasteland.

710
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:55,702
Bigger, stronger, faster!

711
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,379
Immorta!

712
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,941
[all] Immorta! Immorta! Immorta!

713
01:02:01,077 --> 01:02:03,246
[chanting continues]

714
01:02:09,954 --> 01:02:11,760
[hydraulics whirring]

715
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,326
We are going to build
a contraption

716
01:02:22,462 --> 01:02:23,502
that will defend the rear.

717
01:02:23,565 --> 01:02:26,166
We will call it
"The Bommyknocker."

718
01:02:26,301 --> 01:02:28,007
Is that the Praetorian Jack?

719
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,381
He looks lucky.

720
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,370
[War Boy] He done the most runs
on the Fury Road.

721
01:02:41,187 --> 01:02:43,257
And brung back the booty
every time.

722
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,552
Hey. Prae Jack.

723
01:02:52,402 --> 01:02:53,895
[ignition cranks]

724
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:55,837
[motor rumbles to life]

725
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:10,885
[no audible dialogue]

726
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,967
What's going on?

727
01:03:36,745 --> 01:03:38,880
Why so shy? It's just piss.

728
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,455
They were right,
the crazy brothers.

729
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,053
She is a mighty thing.

730
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:53,059
Bigger, faster,
stronger, further.

731
01:04:06,773 --> 01:04:09,339
[motor idling]

732
01:04:20,788 --> 01:04:21,788
[man] Here it comes.

733
01:04:34,198 --> 01:04:36,036
[motor fades into silence]

734
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:57,750
[motor rumbling]

735
01:05:32,025 --> 01:05:33,526
They look like Mortifiers.

736
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:36,059
Mortifiers.
They ride with Dementus.

737
01:05:36,194 --> 01:05:38,089
Not anymore. They've gone rogue.

738
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,290
Contact.

739
01:05:39,426 --> 01:05:41,125
Contact front!

740
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:42,426
You, go!

741
01:05:42,562 --> 01:05:44,434
[overlapping yells]

742
01:05:55,444 --> 01:05:57,914
Contact right. Contact left.

743

744
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,281

[engine dying]

755
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:15,737
[Black Thumb] That's engine two.

756
01:07:20,265 --> 01:07:22,631
All down on top. Replenish!

757
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:25,331
[horn bellowing]

758
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:27,339
[War Boys shouting]

[indistinct shouting]

761
01:08:04,045 --> 01:08:05,976
We need a short hose and clamps!

762
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:08,446
Short hose. Clamps.

763
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,647
Short hose. Clamps.

764
01:08:27,901 --> 01:08:29,269

[gasps]

768
01:09:17,249 --> 01:09:19,286
[aggressive grunting]

769
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:27,222
Yes!

770
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:41,869
Black Thumb? Black Thumb.

771
01:09:50,116 --> 01:09:51,685
[horn blasts]

772
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,820
Up front.

773
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,055
Can I do the Bommyknocker?

774
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,018
- What?
- The Bommyknocker.

775
01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:58,154
Not yet.

776
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:09,429
[War Boy] Eyes left.
They're flanking us.

777
01:10:09,565 --> 01:10:11,365
Eyes right. Eyes right.

778
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,500
They're swarming.

779
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:16,343
Black Thumb.

780
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:27,446
[Praetorian Jack]
Black Thumb! Are you there?

781
01:10:28,483 --> 01:10:30,489
[motor roaring]

782
01:10:31,684 --> 01:10:33,151
Now hang tight.

783
01:10:33,994 --> 01:10:34,994

[laughs triumphantly]

785
01:10:57,844 --> 01:10:59,111
Prae Jack! Prae Jack!

786
01:11:20,301 --> 01:11:24,270
Pissboy. Pissboy!
We got a busted radiator.

787
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,319
[Pissboy]
Copy P-Jack. On my way.

788
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:33,783
Drink, my rig. Drink this piss.

789
01:11:34,418 --> 01:11:35,418
[War Boy] Come on.

790

[grunts]

792
01:11:47,397 --> 01:11:48,397
Prae Jack.

793
01:11:59,844 --> 01:12:01,448
- [bottle whirring]
- [gun blasts]

794
01:12:14,258 --> 01:12:15,858

[yells]

799
01:12:58,403 --> 01:12:59,539

- No!

800
01:13:08,215 --> 01:13:09,274
[fierce grunt]

801
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:38,710

802
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:11,941
[machine gun fire]

803
01:14:24,291 --> 01:14:25,757
[grunts, panting]

804
01:14:32,599 --> 01:14:34,392
[The Octoboss screams, growls]

805
01:14:35,961 --> 01:14:37,967
[motor whining]

806
01:14:45,538 --> 01:14:47,344
The Bommyknocker!
Do the Bommyknocker!

807
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,616
- Now?
- Now!

808
01:14:58,722 --> 01:15:00,290
[gunfire continues]

809
01:15:00,426 --> 01:15:01,694
[gun clicking]

810
01:15:29,785 --> 01:15:30,785
[lever thuds]

811
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,793
[Bommyknocker powers down]

812
01:15:57,316 --> 01:15:58,316
[grunts]

813
01:16:02,322 --> 01:16:03,415
Pull over.

814
01:16:04,892 --> 01:16:07,056
You're going to pull over
and get out.

815
01:16:09,922 --> 01:16:10,928
Stop!

816
01:16:11,594 --> 01:16:12,633
[yelps]

817
01:16:13,398 --> 01:16:14,734
[grunts]

818
01:16:24,103 --> 01:16:25,943
[panting hoarsely]

820
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,222
[panting]

821
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:22,347
[Praetorian Jack] Where did
you think you were going?

822
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:30,437
If you're running away
from the Citadel,

823
01:17:30,573 --> 01:17:33,443
believe me, the Bullet Farm
is a whole lot worse.

824
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,608
The only other place is Gastown.
It's in the hands of Dementus.

825
01:17:37,743 --> 01:17:40,352
A mug who can't even
keep his gangs together.

826
01:17:40,921 --> 01:17:44,087
And that's it.
There is nowhere else.

827
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:46,059
This is the Wasteland.

828
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,521
Wherever you thought
you were going does not exist.

829
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:55,901
It's been a hard day.

830
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:58,563
I lost my convoy.

831
01:17:59,472 --> 01:18:00,741
I lost my crew.

832
01:18:01,973 --> 01:18:03,678
I'm gonna have to start again.

833
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,815
And I'm driving off thinking
I ought to start with you.

834
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:13,951
You got good vision.

835
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:15,783
You read the play
and you keep your head.

836
01:18:16,286 --> 01:18:17,819
You may be raw,
but you have about you

837
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:19,617
a purposeful savagery.

838
01:18:21,121 --> 01:18:23,161
You give me time,

839
01:18:23,297 --> 01:18:25,856
I'll teach you everything
you need to know about Road War.

840
01:18:26,826 --> 01:18:29,867
If you survive everything
we take on together,

841
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:31,143
you'll have
all the skills you need

842
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,070
to get wherever you wanna go.

843
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,173
No questions asked.

844
01:18:50,118 --> 01:18:52,056
Keep it. You'll need it.

845
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:26,926
[mother] <i>The stars be with you.</i>

846
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:32,558
<i>The stars be with you.</i>

847
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,738
[Dementus] <i>You and me, Little D.</i>

01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,184
[men chanting and
clapping rhythmically]

850
01:20:04,895 --> 01:20:06,801
[all cheering]

851
01:20:08,098 --> 01:20:11,437
[all chanting] Immortan Joe!

852
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,434
[continuing, indistinct]

853
01:20:30,821 --> 01:20:32,585
[chanting fades]

854
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:39,031
[indistinct chatter, shouting]

855
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:51,840
[War Boy] Two... four...
six... eight...

856
01:20:51,976 --> 01:20:53,507
Done. Tank's empty.

857
01:20:55,009 --> 01:20:56,761
Everything accounted, down to
the last drop of Mother's Milk.

858
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,346
- Good.
- No, it's not good.

859
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:01,051
That piece of anus-pus,
Dementus,

860
01:21:01,186 --> 01:21:02,888
is running Gastown
into the ground

861
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,617
and blaming everyone
but himself.

862
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:07,393
You tell Immortan Joe
we need a meeting.

863
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,129
A war meeting.

864
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:12,593
Otherwise we're gonna get
our tits caught in the wringer.

865
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:15,826
Here's the boomstick
you asked for.

866
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:27,244
[Furiosa] Thundersticks.
Bullets all loaded.

867
01:21:28,507 --> 01:21:30,511
[engine cranks, starts]

868
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:40,191
[War Boy shouting indistinctly]

869
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,396
For you.

870
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:53,974
For your travels.

871
01:21:55,335 --> 01:21:56,801
You're done here.

872
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,243
You're free to go.

873
01:22:01,743 --> 01:22:05,953
Food, water, wheels,
whatever you need.

874
01:22:07,515 --> 01:22:09,418
I'll help you put it together.

875
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:13,158
Give me a couple of days.

876
01:22:31,941 --> 01:22:32,941
[gasps]

877
01:22:33,713 --> 01:22:35,741
[panting]

878
01:22:58,366 --> 01:23:00,573
[warning horn blaring]

879
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,735
[machinery clanking]

880
01:23:04,975 --> 01:23:06,838
[gate rumbling]

881
01:23:12,619 --> 01:23:14,081
[coughs]

882
01:23:14,216 --> 01:23:15,649
We'll lead you in.

883
01:23:31,707 --> 01:23:33,535
[gate hinges creaking]

884
01:23:35,635 --> 01:23:37,473
[crowds shouting, yelling]

885
01:24:01,297 --> 01:24:02,525
[indistinct shouting]

886
01:24:02,661 --> 01:24:05,336
Move! Hurry up! Come on!

887
01:24:08,403 --> 01:24:10,209
Back! Get out then!

888
01:24:10,975 --> 01:24:14,081
[gunshots]

889
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:25,890
[Dementus, over P.A.] <i>Stay back!</i>

890
01:24:26,025 --> 01:24:27,985
<i>Back! Stand back.</i>

891
01:24:30,624 --> 01:24:33,496
<i>Citizens of Gastown.</i>

892
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:37,131
<i>I want what you want.
A full belly...</i>

893
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:40,239
and a fistful of bullets
for a tank of gas.

894
01:24:42,174 --> 01:24:44,177
We have to put things right.

895
01:24:46,205 --> 01:24:49,215
And today, we're gonna
do something about it.

896
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,255
Are you in charge here?

897
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:01,051
You can speak to me.

898
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:02,586
[Dementus] Yeah.

899
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:05,462
Well, I've got a message
for Immortan Joe.

900
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:09,361
We're in a black spiral here.

901
01:25:09,497 --> 01:25:11,767
We can't keep up supply.

902
01:25:11,903 --> 01:25:15,239
Everyone is saying they're being
swindled and short-changed.

903
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:16,655
Everyone is saying
it's my fault.

904
01:25:17,241 --> 01:25:18,706
It's everyone's fault.

905
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:22,110
I want a meeting
of the warlords.

906
01:25:22,846 --> 01:25:26,649
Me, him, the People Eater,
that idiot Bullet Farmer.

907
01:25:26,784 --> 01:25:29,519
High noon at the Citadel.
Three days from now.

908
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:33,451
Right.

909
01:25:33,554 --> 01:25:35,153
[crowd yelling angrily]

910
01:25:35,989 --> 01:25:37,469
- Ah, you better go.
- [dogs snarling]

911
01:25:38,565 --> 01:25:40,860
We're not leaving
without our tankers full of gas.

912
01:25:41,902 --> 01:25:42,961
[muffled boom]

913
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:45,133
Go now.

914
01:25:45,269 --> 01:25:46,305
[explosions booming]

915
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:55,215
[all shouting, indistinct]

916
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,614
You wanna get out of here,
follow me.

917
01:26:03,417 --> 01:26:05,687
[engine roaring]

918
01:26:16,430 --> 01:26:17,567
[yelling]

919
01:26:37,255 --> 01:26:39,820
[crowd roaring angrily]

920
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:03,580
High noon, the Citadel,
three days from now.

921
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,483
Be punctual.

922
01:27:14,994 --> 01:27:16,923
[flies swarming]

923
01:27:39,184 --> 01:27:40,749
[sighs deeply]

924
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:46,337
[People Eater] You give him
a full tank of water,

925
01:27:46,425 --> 01:27:48,821
and 2,000 tits of Mother's Milk

926
01:27:48,957 --> 01:27:51,831
and then you return
empty-handed.

927
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:53,760
Not a drop of guzzolene.

928
01:27:53,896 --> 01:27:55,429
He filched us.
We're being filched.

929
01:27:55,565 --> 01:27:57,262
Let's kill him. Right now.

930
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:59,731
Shoulda done it long ago, Dad.
Shoulda crushed him, Dad!

931
01:27:59,866 --> 01:28:01,232
Father, give me the War Rig.

932
01:28:01,367 --> 01:28:03,410
Load it up with all
of the firepower you've got,

933
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,743
and I will blow him
from the face of the earth.

934
01:28:05,879 --> 01:28:07,882
[People Eater] How do we do that
before he blows up Gastown?

935
01:28:07,906 --> 01:28:08,973
We'll build it again.

936
01:28:09,108 --> 01:28:10,850
That'd take generations,
you moron.

937
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:12,517
We will build it again.

938
01:28:12,652 --> 01:28:15,111
Your way of thinking
is how he rooks us.

939
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:16,459
He's got you scared
of his crazy.

940
01:28:16,483 --> 01:28:17,483
Bah!

941
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,017
[Immortan Joe]
Here's what we do!

942
01:28:19,152 --> 01:28:21,150
We conserve every drop
of guzzolene,

943
01:28:21,286 --> 01:28:23,127
turn off all vehicles,
all generators.

944
01:28:23,263 --> 01:28:24,494
Turn off every water pump

945
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,324
including the Big Four
Aquifer Siphons.

946
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,497
Get.

947
01:28:27,633 --> 01:28:29,462
At first light, leave
for Bullet Farm

948
01:28:29,598 --> 01:28:31,932
with your tankers empty.

949
01:28:32,067 --> 01:28:36,068
Then, return with every munition
you can load.

950
01:28:37,403 --> 01:28:41,138
I want every bullet and firearm,
every caliber and size.

951
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:43,782
Your entire infantry
ready to pick up.

952
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:44,917
Good.

953
01:28:45,652 --> 01:28:47,620
Come to the watchtower.
We'll signal them now.

954
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:50,787
[Scrotus] Hell and Hall-elujah!
We're gonna take Gastown.

955
01:28:50,922 --> 01:28:52,962
[Rictus] Hit him! Hit him
when he least suspects it.

956
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:55,758
[People Eater] How do we
stop him blowing up Gastown?

957
01:29:07,271 --> 01:29:08,936
[tools scraping]

958
01:29:21,688 --> 01:29:25,656
This place at the end
of your map of secrets.

959
01:29:27,588 --> 01:29:28,588
Where is it?

960
01:29:42,242 --> 01:29:43,267
My mother and father...

961
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:46,072
were soldiers.

962
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:49,582
Even as the world fell,

963
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,584
they yearned to be warriors
for a virtuous cause.

964
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,951
For them, it never happened.

965
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:02,429
I wanna help you
find this place.

966
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:06,092
Wherever it may be.

967
01:30:33,589 --> 01:30:34,593
Come with me.

968
01:31:13,727 --> 01:31:14,727
[Furiosa] Ready?

969
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:18,263
[horn blaring]

970
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:25,270
[hydraulics hissing]

971
01:31:28,044 --> 01:31:29,352
[Praetorian Jack]
I want your bikes.

972
01:31:29,376 --> 01:31:30,896
Load them on the back
of the V8 Pursuit

973
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,112
and tie them down.

974
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:36,015
- [War Boys shouting]
- Soon as that's done,

975
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,157
load it with food,
fuel and water.

976
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:39,891
As much as you can carry.

977
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:42,529
[War Boy] What's this?
A scouting party?

978
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:44,510
[Praetorian Jack] Possibly.

979
01:31:46,961 --> 01:31:48,295
[War Boy 2] What about us?

980
01:31:48,431 --> 01:31:50,246
[Praetorian Jack] You're both
gonna ride on the tanker.

981
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:51,501
What about me?

982
01:31:51,637 --> 01:31:53,639
You're promoted. Rear defense.

983
01:31:54,607 --> 01:31:55,767
- On the War Rig?
- Of course.

984
01:31:57,872 --> 01:31:59,007
What are you doing?

985
01:32:00,776 --> 01:32:02,312
Is there a problem?

986
01:32:02,447 --> 01:32:03,649
You drive the V8.

987
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:05,583
I drive the War Rig.

988
01:32:05,718 --> 01:32:07,983
Not today.
Today you drive Pursuit.

989
01:32:09,181 --> 01:32:10,193
[driver] What am I gonna do?

990
01:32:10,217 --> 01:32:10,949
[Praetorian Jack]
You're with me.

991
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:12,582
- Up front?
- Up front.

992
01:32:12,717 --> 01:32:14,597
As soon as we load up
the weapons and munitions,

993
01:32:14,725 --> 01:32:16,655
you can drive the rig back.

994
01:32:17,325 --> 01:32:19,532
[driver] All the way home?
To the Citadel?

995
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,331
- [Praetorian Jack] Yep.
- [driver laughs]

996
01:32:21,467 --> 01:32:22,265
[Praetorian Jack] Go on.

997
01:32:22,401 --> 01:32:23,401
[driver] Whoo!

998
01:32:24,404 --> 01:32:26,364
[truck engine starts]

999
01:32:33,742 --> 01:32:35,274
[horn honking]

1000
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:38,750
Wanna see what this can do?

1001
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:40,917
Hit the second engine.

1002
01:32:42,488 --> 01:32:44,316
[engine ignites, starts]

1003
01:32:45,492 --> 01:32:47,418
[driver whooping joyfully]

1004
01:32:48,153 --> 01:32:50,025
[truck horn blaring]

1005
01:33:33,408 --> 01:33:36,203
[truck hisses, falls silent]

1006
01:33:43,383 --> 01:33:44,409
[horn blaring]

1007
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,655
[gunfire]

1008
01:33:57,958 --> 01:33:58,958
[biker] All dead?

1009
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:00,433
[biker 2] Don't know.

1010
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,769
- [gunshot]
- [biker 3] Sniper ambush!

1011
01:34:05,805 --> 01:34:07,598
[biker]
He's got backup. Outside.

1012
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:09,387
[biker 4] Between the tanks.

1013
01:34:09,903 --> 01:34:10,941
[bullet clangs]

1014
01:34:13,172 --> 01:34:14,307
[biker] I can't see him.

1015
01:34:15,777 --> 01:34:16,881
[panting]

1016
01:34:21,915 --> 01:34:22,915
[gunshot]

1017
01:34:23,752 --> 01:34:24,856
[gunshot]

1018
01:34:26,856 --> 01:34:27,856
[biker 5] Behind you.

1019
01:34:30,660 --> 01:34:31,824
[body thuds]

1020
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:33,132
[motorcycle approaching]

1021
01:34:33,267 --> 01:34:34,294
[gunshot]

1022
01:34:44,838 --> 01:34:45,838
[gasps]

1023
01:34:57,115 --> 01:34:58,989
[motor revving]

1024
01:35:16,442 --> 01:35:18,408
[panting deeply]

1025
01:35:18,544 --> 01:35:19,807
[honking horn]

1026
01:35:19,942 --> 01:35:21,748
[vehicles approaching]

1027
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,415
[flare gun clicks]

1028
01:35:34,791 --> 01:35:36,554
[boom echoing]

1029
01:35:47,969 --> 01:35:49,776
[engines roaring]

1030
01:35:57,713 --> 01:35:58,818
[grunts]

1031
01:36:12,697 --> 01:36:13,723
[shifts gears]

1032
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:40,288
[panting deeply]

1033
01:36:47,228 --> 01:36:48,508
[Dementus, faintly] Do not miss.

1034
01:37:13,385 --> 01:37:14,927
[breathing hoarsely]

1035
01:37:17,325 --> 01:37:18,689
- [bullet whistles]
- Whoo!

1036
01:37:23,327 --> 01:37:24,530
[bullet hisses]

1037
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,482
Where are they?
Can you see them?

1038
01:37:44,117 --> 01:37:45,122
[bullet hisses]

1039
01:37:46,257 --> 01:37:47,737
On the ridge,
to the left of the gate.

1040
01:38:03,676 --> 01:38:05,274
[people screaming]

1041
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,606
Give me that.

1042
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:20,025
All right, load me up.
Come on.

1043
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:22,220
Come here.

1044
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:29,502
[exclaiming]

1045
01:38:38,072 --> 01:38:40,474

1046
01:39:20,081 --> 01:39:21,383

1047
01:39:37,132 --> 01:39:38,796
[people screaming]

1048
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:45,979
Jack!

1049
01:40:34,024 --> 01:40:35,655
Yeah? We're good.

1050
01:41:10,525 --> 01:41:12,597
We'll head east for three days.

1051
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:15,642
Once we clear the escarpment
and the great salt plains,

1052
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:17,895
we'll take the bikes
over the dunes all the way.

1053
01:41:19,233 --> 01:41:20,535
All the way.

1054
01:41:41,723 --> 01:41:43,692
The digger.
Let's use the digger.

1055
01:41:43,828 --> 01:41:44,922
No time.

1056
01:41:47,898 --> 01:41:48,898
Out.

1057
01:42:15,454 --> 01:42:16,492
[growling]

1058
01:43:43,212 --> 01:43:45,218
[engine roaring]

1059
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,977
Fang it! Fang it!

1060
01:44:46,407 --> 01:44:47,742
[screams]

1061
01:45:00,818 --> 01:45:03,252
[sound fades]

1062
01:45:09,596 --> 01:45:11,469
[engine shuts off]

1063
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:17,310
[grunting with effort]

1064
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:25,818
Hello?

1065
01:45:26,886 --> 01:45:27,947
Heh?

1066
01:45:39,726 --> 01:45:41,701
[motorbikes approaching]

1067
01:45:41,836 --> 01:45:43,336
[grunting]

1068
01:45:51,605 --> 01:45:53,478
[bikers cheering]

1069
01:45:59,286 --> 01:46:00,819
[man] This one's still alive!

1070
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:01,954
[Dementus] Good.

1071
01:46:04,783 --> 01:46:06,359
[Furiosa gasping]

1072
01:46:08,755 --> 01:46:09,890
[man 2] Get up here.

1073
01:46:10,757 --> 01:46:11,991
Come on, get up here.

1074
01:46:14,463 --> 01:46:16,730
Did you see that?

1075
01:46:16,866 --> 01:46:18,312
You see how they fought
for each other,

1076
01:46:18,336 --> 01:46:20,230
this little army of two?

1077
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:24,168
Where were they going,
so full of hope?

1078
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,405
There is no hope!

1079
01:46:28,374 --> 01:46:31,015
Not for them, not for you!
Certainly not for me!

1080
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:33,080
[biker whimpers, yelps]

1081
01:46:33,215 --> 01:46:36,422
The day I acquire Bullet Farm,
these two destroy it.

1082
01:46:37,854 --> 01:46:39,788
I had Gastown,
I had Bullet Farm.

1083
01:46:39,923 --> 01:46:41,502
With that,
I coulda crippled the Citadel.

1084
01:46:41,526 --> 01:46:43,429
- Jack.
- Ruled the Wasteland!

1085
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,164
- The Wasteland woulda been...
- My Jack.

1086
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:45,887
A far better place
for all of us.

1087
01:46:46,023 --> 01:46:46,855
[Praetorian Jack] Fury.

1088
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,401
- Jack.
- No!

1089
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,730
[man 2] Get up.

1090
01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:54,401
[voice strained] You two.

1091
01:46:54,537 --> 01:46:56,975
You two break my heart.

1092
01:46:57,111 --> 01:46:58,367
You break my heart.

1093
01:46:59,608 --> 01:47:00,743
And that's not fair.

1094
01:47:02,206 --> 01:47:05,583
You make me the Dark Dementus.

1095
01:47:06,786 --> 01:47:09,920
The Dark Dementus
cannot afford to be soft!

1096
01:47:10,723 --> 01:47:13,483
It's the price I pay
to be your leader!

1097
01:47:13,619 --> 01:47:16,390
It's the price we all pay
to survive in the Wasteland.

1098
01:47:16,525 --> 01:47:18,794
We cannot be soft!

1099
01:47:21,367 --> 01:47:23,095
There must be retribution.

1100
01:47:25,205 --> 01:47:27,869
Justice and retribution.

1101
01:47:29,571 --> 01:47:31,543
[motors starting]

1102
01:47:37,710 --> 01:47:39,309
[cackling]

1103
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:44,917
[Dementus] Hey, hey, hey!

1104
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:49,419
I want her to watch a while.
String her up.

1105
01:47:50,455 --> 01:47:54,163
You're going. You're going.
You're going.

1106
01:47:54,298 --> 01:47:55,298
[man] Let's go.

1107
01:48:03,034 --> 01:48:04,510
No, mate, other arm.

1108
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:09,944
What? You lost your touch?

1109
01:48:11,644 --> 01:48:12,749
[growls]

1110
01:48:13,913 --> 01:48:14,916
[Mr. Norton] I'll do it.

1111
01:48:17,952 --> 01:48:19,822
- [winch whirring]
- [gasps]

1112
01:48:38,546 --> 01:48:41,679
[biker] Come on, piggy!
Get up. Get up!

1113
01:48:57,791 --> 01:48:58,921
Let's go. Go.

1114
01:48:59,057 --> 01:49:00,929
[growling, barking]

1115
01:50:01,193 --> 01:50:02,353
Smeg!

1116
01:50:09,997 --> 01:50:11,802
[amplified] Enough! Enough!

1117
01:50:13,197 --> 01:50:14,398
[quietly] I'm bored.

1118
01:50:16,201 --> 01:50:18,204
Let's end our cares and go home!

1119
01:50:45,339 --> 01:50:47,270
[shouting, indistinct]

1120
01:50:47,405 --> 01:50:49,433
[engine roaring]

1121
01:50:50,573 --> 01:50:51,776
[metal breaking]

1122
01:51:06,919 --> 01:51:08,793
[motor revving]

1123
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:40,693
[panting heavily]

1124
01:51:52,803 --> 01:51:54,630
[ravens crying in distance]

1125
01:52:12,292 --> 01:52:14,155
[flies buzzing]

1126
01:52:36,109 --> 01:52:37,911
[gasping violently]

1127
01:52:38,046 --> 01:52:39,413
[old woman] It's all right.

1128
01:52:40,416 --> 01:52:43,382
Go back to sleep.
I'll make it nice for you.

1129
01:52:45,852 --> 01:52:46,852
Stay!

1130
01:52:48,055 --> 01:52:49,894
You'll find peace here.

1131
01:52:52,861 --> 01:52:54,261
[people shouting]

1132
01:52:56,600 --> 01:52:58,800
[yelling]

1133
01:52:58,935 --> 01:53:00,465
I'm the Praetorian Furiosa.

1134
01:53:01,803 --> 01:53:02,672
[angry yell]

1135
01:53:02,807 --> 01:53:04,909
I am the Praetorian Furiosa!

1136
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:06,911
What happened to you?

1137
01:53:07,412 --> 01:53:08,473
Pull.

1138
01:53:17,591 --> 01:53:19,147
[Bullet Farmer] Any sign of him?

1139
01:53:19,282 --> 01:53:20,282
[Rictus] No.

1140
01:53:21,093 --> 01:53:22,828
But there's something going on
at Gastown.

1141
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,187
I think he's blowing up Gastown.

1142
01:53:25,323 --> 01:53:26,664
[Bullet Farmer] Rubbish.

1143
01:53:26,799 --> 01:53:27,965
- Take a look.
- [growls]

1144
01:53:29,533 --> 01:53:32,728
[People Eater] He fails to turn
up to a meeting and now this.

1145
01:53:35,741 --> 01:53:36,998
[Immortan Joe] It's fake.

1146
01:53:37,601 --> 01:53:39,301
There's no possible advantage.

1147
01:53:39,437 --> 01:53:40,937
We shouldn't have waited.

1148
01:53:41,806 --> 01:53:44,516
Why're we waiting now?
Let's go to Gastown now.

1149
01:53:44,652 --> 01:53:45,917
[Furiosa] He's not at Gastown.

1150
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:50,647
[Bullet Farmer]
Where's Praetorian Jack?

1151
01:53:51,954 --> 01:53:53,187
Where's our War Rig?

1152
01:53:53,323 --> 01:53:54,569
[Furiosa]
He's taken the Bullet Farm.

1153
01:53:54,593 --> 01:53:55,593
You're lying.

1154
01:53:55,654 --> 01:53:56,771
[Furiosa] He's taken
the Bullet Farm,

1155
01:53:56,795 --> 01:53:58,287
and he's coming here next.

1156
01:53:58,422 --> 01:53:59,855
How do you know that?

1157
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:02,160
They're coming with
grappling hooks and ladders.

1158
01:54:02,296 --> 01:54:03,968
He wants to take the Citadel.

1159
01:54:04,103 --> 01:54:05,538
[Bullet Farmer]
Then we go to the Bullet Farm.

1160
01:54:05,562 --> 01:54:07,136
Meet him head-on right now.

1161
01:54:07,271 --> 01:54:09,640
It's Gastown that's burning.
He's at Gastown.

1162
01:54:09,775 --> 01:54:11,943
He wants to draw you to Gastown.

1163
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:14,103
He wants you to leave
the Citadel exposed.

1164
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:15,611
So we stay here.

1165
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:19,215
We have three choices.
The coward's choice.

1166
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:22,046
Stay here and let Dementus
mess with our minds.

1167
01:54:22,181 --> 01:54:23,348
The fool's choice,

1168
01:54:23,483 --> 01:54:24,887
go out and meet
an invisible enemy

1169
01:54:25,022 --> 01:54:26,882
on the road to the Bullet Farm.

1170
01:54:27,017 --> 01:54:30,519
Or the warrior's choice,
go to Gastown and crush him.

1171
01:54:30,654 --> 01:54:32,259
[Immortan Joe] It is my choice.

1172
01:54:32,395 --> 01:54:34,328
We make him think
we're going to Gastown.

1173
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:36,429
[growls]

1174
01:54:37,528 --> 01:54:39,234
If you find him, he's mine.

1175
01:55:04,563 --> 01:55:05,898
Yes. Yes!

1176
01:55:08,761 --> 01:55:10,562
[Smeg] They're Gastown bound
for sure.

1177
01:55:16,874 --> 01:55:18,099
[Dementus] So gullible.

1178
01:55:18,902 --> 01:55:20,979
I hold them profoundly
in contempt.

1179
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:35,025
Gentlemans, it's time.
Time to do war.

1180
01:55:35,161 --> 01:55:37,626
Time to take back
what's rightfully ours.

1181
01:55:37,761 --> 01:55:39,188
To the Citadel.

1182
01:55:39,323 --> 01:55:41,223
Let's party!

1183
01:55:41,358 --> 01:55:43,727
[bikers roaring]

1184
01:56:02,016 --> 01:56:03,780
[gears whirring]

1185
01:56:36,189 --> 01:56:38,347
[History Man]
<i>There always was, is,</i>

1186
01:56:38,483 --> 01:56:40,520
<i>and will be war.</i>

1187
01:56:43,126 --> 01:56:45,030
<i>The Sumerian fought the Elamite.</i>

1188
01:56:46,097 --> 01:56:48,165
<i>The Saxon fought the Viking.</i>

1189
01:56:49,837 --> 01:56:51,762
<i>And so the histories grew.</i>

1190
01:56:52,931 --> 01:56:54,902
<i>There were the Wars
of the Roses,</i>

1191
01:56:55,037 --> 01:56:56,206
<i>The Oranges.</i>

1192
01:56:56,973 --> 01:56:58,670
<i>The Opium Wars.</i>

1193
01:57:00,478 --> 01:57:04,643
<i>The One-Day, Six-Day,
Thousand-Day Wars.</i>

1194
01:57:07,881 --> 01:57:11,716
<i>North against South.
East against West.</i>

1195
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:20,395
<i>The first, second,
third countless wars</i>

1196
01:57:20,530 --> 01:57:22,595
<i>of religion
and righteous belief.</i>

1197
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:30,072
<i>The Oil Wars. Water Wars.</i>

1198
01:57:30,207 --> 01:57:32,110
<i>The Tri-Nation Nuclear War.</i>

1199
01:57:33,507 --> 01:57:35,839
<i>The Battle of the Boomtowns.</i>

1200
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:39,084
<i>And now, my dears...</i>

1201
01:57:40,381 --> 01:57:42,879
<i>The Forty-Day Wasteland War.</i>

1202
01:58:01,466 --> 01:58:03,603
<i>Eyes for eyes.</i>

1203
01:58:04,668 --> 01:58:06,672
<i>Teeth for teeth.</i>

1204
01:58:09,476 --> 01:58:12,117
<i>Rage fueled by grief.</i>

1205
01:58:36,404 --> 01:58:37,484
[Furiosa] I need a vehicle.

1206
01:58:38,905 --> 01:58:40,444
There's nothing here,
not even a bike.

1207
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:43,071
- [Furiosa] Winch me down.
- What're you gonna do? Walk?

1208
01:58:47,315 --> 01:58:48,813
I've got a vehicle.

1209
01:58:58,625 --> 01:59:00,495
Can't wait for you to see it.

1210
01:59:07,335 --> 01:59:08,998
Isn't she wonderful?

1211
01:59:13,845 --> 01:59:15,180
[chuckles]

1212
02:00:08,967 --> 02:00:10,059
[stops engine]

1213
02:00:22,642 --> 02:00:24,249
[War Boy] Hey! Look at this.

1214
02:00:25,678 --> 02:00:27,219
I think this one might fit.

1215
02:00:29,155 --> 02:00:31,014
[Scrotus] Try it on! Try it on!

1216
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:36,250
Every moment wasted,

1217
02:00:36,386 --> 02:00:39,055
that mongrel gets
farther and farther away.

1218
02:00:39,658 --> 02:00:40,694
[War Boy] Coming up!

1219
02:00:42,367 --> 02:00:43,896
[Scrotus]
And I want her fuel too.

1220
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:47,195
I want all of her fuel,
and her water and her weapon.

1221
02:00:48,736 --> 02:00:51,573
A fool can run,
but he can't hide.

1222
02:00:54,704 --> 02:00:55,704
It's gonna fit.

1223
02:00:56,874 --> 02:00:58,244
[Organic Mechanic] Hey, Scrotus.

1224
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:00,084
- Scrotus!
- What?

1225
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:02,384
You'll need some proper tucker.

1226
02:01:02,519 --> 02:01:04,253
- Canine kebab.
- [dismissive growl]

1227
02:01:04,388 --> 02:01:05,628
[Rictus] We'll take it with us.

1228
02:01:05,717 --> 02:01:06,824
What do you mean, "us?"

1229
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,118
I'm coming with you.

1230
02:01:08,253 --> 02:01:09,936
[Scrotus] No, you're not.
You'll slow me down.

1231
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:12,107
[Rictus] I'm gonna make sure
that dumb Dementus is dead.

1232
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:12,954
[Scrotus] No, you're not!

1233
02:01:13,089 --> 02:01:14,490
You stay here and eat some dog.

1234
02:01:14,625 --> 02:01:16,664
[engine roaring]

1235
02:01:26,804 --> 02:01:28,236
[Scrotus] What was that?

1236
02:01:28,372 --> 02:01:31,745
[History Man]
That is the darkest of angels.

1237
02:01:32,714 --> 02:01:35,177
The fifth Rider
of the Apocalypse.

1238
02:01:50,927 --> 02:01:52,799
[bullet whistles, thuds]

1239
02:01:54,698 --> 02:01:56,000
[bullet strikes]

1240
02:02:08,822 --> 02:02:11,587
[panting]

1241
02:02:25,939 --> 02:02:26,939
Who are they?

1242
02:02:27,497 --> 02:02:30,305
Someone competent
and excessively resentful.

1243
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:31,667
Who do you suppose they want?

1244
02:02:31,803 --> 02:02:33,301
Me, without my crew.

1245
02:02:34,675 --> 02:02:36,508
We'll wait here. Ambush him.

1246
02:02:36,644 --> 02:02:37,745
[Big Jilly] Let's go back.

1247
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:39,560
[Dementus] No, no, no.
We have to split up.

1248
02:02:40,109 --> 02:02:42,044
Here, no time for long goodbyes.

1249
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,656
We've done some
mighty things together.

1250
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:44,680
Goodbye.

1251
02:02:56,694 --> 02:02:58,227
[squawking]

1252
02:03:33,105 --> 02:03:35,066
[engine revs]

1253
02:04:22,913 --> 02:04:24,049
I'm not Dementus!

1254
02:04:27,687 --> 02:04:29,461
We swapped bikes!

1255
02:04:48,905 --> 02:04:50,812
[panicked shout]

1256
02:05:44,367 --> 02:05:46,329
[faint cheering]

1257
02:05:59,316 --> 02:06:01,212
[wind whistling]

1258
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,425
[takes deep breath]

1259
02:06:56,208 --> 02:06:58,775
[panting]

1260
02:07:07,285 --> 02:07:08,510
You've found me.

1261
02:07:11,322 --> 02:07:12,580
Freakish.

1262
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:15,154
You are a freak.

1263
02:07:18,097 --> 02:07:20,993
You could have necked me
in the night, but you didn't.

1264
02:07:21,128 --> 02:07:23,668
So, you must be
that other thing.

1265
02:07:24,766 --> 02:07:26,594
Are you that thing?

1266
02:07:32,102 --> 02:07:33,436
[exhales sharply]

1267
02:07:48,590 --> 02:07:50,959
[panting]

1268
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:15,951
[panting heavily]

1269
02:08:42,546 --> 02:08:43,814
[gun clatters]

1270
02:09:03,766 --> 02:09:05,600
[motor switches off]

1271
02:09:05,736 --> 02:09:07,266
[Dementus] I have nothing.

1272
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:10,097
I am nothing.

1273
02:09:10,233 --> 02:09:11,802
[door closes]

1274
02:09:11,937 --> 02:09:12,937
I'm yours.

1275
02:09:20,342 --> 02:09:22,215
[chains jingling]

1276
02:09:34,533 --> 02:09:35,657
[Furiosa] Remember me?

1277
02:09:49,405 --> 02:09:51,981
You fabulous thing.

1278
02:09:55,118 --> 02:09:57,783
You crawled
out of a pitiless grave,

1279
02:09:57,918 --> 02:09:59,285
deeper than Hell.

1280
02:10:00,553 --> 02:10:02,524
And only one thing's
gonna do that for you.

1281
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,422
And not hope. Hate.

1282
02:10:06,762 --> 02:10:08,491
No shame in hate.

1283
02:10:08,627 --> 02:10:10,725
It's one of the great forces
of nature.

1284
02:10:15,138 --> 02:10:16,841
That wasn't hope,
that was instinct.

1285
02:10:19,875 --> 02:10:20,977
[water drop splashes]

1286
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:23,243
[splash]

1287
02:10:26,109 --> 02:10:27,478
[splash]

1288
02:10:32,082 --> 02:10:33,082
So...

1289
02:10:34,627 --> 02:10:36,423
this is the day I die.

1290
02:10:37,159 --> 02:10:38,621
I've always wondered how...
[chokes]

1291
02:10:42,759 --> 02:10:45,030
Fifteen years ago
there was a woman.

1292
02:10:45,165 --> 02:10:46,964
Oh, so there's more to this.

1293
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,433
Do you remember her?

1294
02:10:49,265 --> 02:10:50,600
Do I get a clue?

1295
02:10:56,108 --> 02:10:58,482
Right, okay. Um...

1296
02:10:58,617 --> 02:11:00,546
Redhead. Even her pu...

1297
02:11:00,682 --> 02:11:01,682
[grunts]

1298
02:11:03,821 --> 02:11:06,821
Was she your mother? Sister?

1299
02:11:06,956 --> 02:11:08,984
Did she beg, did she scream?

1300
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:11,753
The ones who yell the least tend
to stick in my mind. [groaning]

1301
02:11:12,859 --> 02:11:13,929
[coughs]

1302
02:11:14,064 --> 02:11:15,368
Despite everything
you did to her,

1303
02:11:15,392 --> 02:11:16,862
she was magnificent.

1304
02:11:16,998 --> 02:11:17,998
Oh, you were there.

1305
02:11:19,305 --> 02:11:20,668
[groans]

1306
02:11:20,804 --> 02:11:23,402
My childhood. My mother.

1307
02:11:24,576 --> 02:11:25,734
I want them back.

1308
02:11:26,644 --> 02:11:27,644
Of course you do.

1309
02:11:27,678 --> 02:11:29,106
I want them back!

1310
02:11:29,242 --> 02:11:30,578
That's exactly how I felt.

1311
02:11:31,314 --> 02:11:34,013
My own family.
My own magnificent beauties.

1312
02:11:34,149 --> 02:11:36,712
Taken so unjustly. Immutably.

1313
02:11:36,847 --> 02:11:38,780
I'm right there,
I'm right there with you.

1314
02:11:41,257 --> 02:11:43,791
I too craved nothing
but revenge.

1315
02:11:43,927 --> 02:11:45,626
A big bellyful of revenge.

1316
02:11:45,761 --> 02:11:47,288
[gun clicks]

1317
02:11:47,424 --> 02:11:49,395
[growls] If I may...

1318
02:11:51,003 --> 02:11:52,470
If the shooter goes
around the back,

1319
02:11:52,605 --> 02:11:53,605
the shootee won't know

1320
02:11:53,698 --> 02:11:56,039
the precise moment
of the execution.

1321
02:11:57,934 --> 02:12:00,302
Minor torture,
but every little bit counts.

1322
02:12:00,438 --> 02:12:01,572
Either way, that rat shot

1323
02:12:01,708 --> 02:12:03,772
will turn my brain
into a pink mist so fast,

1324
02:12:03,907 --> 02:12:05,642
I won't even hear
the sound of the gun.

1325
02:12:06,585 --> 02:12:08,046
I'll hear it.

1326
02:12:08,549 --> 02:12:09,897
I'll hear it for the rest
of my days.

1327
02:12:09,921 --> 02:12:11,065
[Dementus] Of course you will.

1328
02:12:11,089 --> 02:12:12,719
I'll feel the kickback
in my hand.

1329
02:12:12,854 --> 02:12:13,854
[Dementus] Sure.

1330
02:12:15,551 --> 02:12:17,759
I'll remember your face.

1331
02:12:17,895 --> 02:12:19,896
As the slug worms its way

1332
02:12:20,032 --> 02:12:21,625
into the soft matter
of your brain,

1333
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,759
taking with it what you call
your reason.

1334
02:12:24,701 --> 02:12:25,937
And your memory,

1335
02:12:27,272 --> 02:12:29,637
from which my mother
will fortunately be absent.

1336
02:12:29,772 --> 02:12:30,772
Brilliant.

1337
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:33,373
I'll be dead and you'll
still be sorrowing

1338
02:12:33,508 --> 02:12:35,980
your lovey-dovey and
your mommy magnificent.

1339
02:12:36,548 --> 02:12:37,874
You idiot.

1340
02:12:38,009 --> 02:12:40,215
You can never balance
the scales of their suffering.

1341
02:12:42,114 --> 02:12:43,114
[groans softly]

1342
02:12:43,746 --> 02:12:46,815
- Give them back.
- I can't!

1343
02:12:48,127 --> 02:12:50,417
What you want, dear,
are my cries of anguish.

1344
02:12:50,553 --> 02:12:52,160
Anguish without end.

1345
02:12:52,296 --> 02:12:54,460
And if I could give you that,
I would.

1346
02:12:54,595 --> 02:12:56,764
But I don't fear
the loss of bliss in Heaven.

1347
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:59,168
Or retribution in Hell.

1348
02:12:59,303 --> 02:13:01,169
And I've got a fiendishly high
pain threshold.

1349
02:13:01,305 --> 02:13:03,231
- [Furiosa shrieks]
- Again, do it again.

1350
02:13:03,366 --> 02:13:05,240
[yells, panting]

1351
02:13:09,245 --> 02:13:11,912
[panting] If you
can't do me quick,

1352
02:13:12,048 --> 02:13:13,316
you'll have to do me slow.

1353
02:13:13,452 --> 02:13:14,978
[spits]

1354
02:13:15,113 --> 02:13:18,851
But you are never going to get
anything close to what you want.

1355
02:13:18,986 --> 02:13:21,025
[grunting]

1356
02:13:33,365 --> 02:13:34,830
[gun hits the sand]

1357
02:13:38,139 --> 02:13:40,011
[tiny motor running]

1358
02:14:15,713 --> 02:14:17,312
Little D?

1359
02:14:21,115 --> 02:14:23,545
[laughing weakly]

1360
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:26,321
I have been waiting for you.

1361
02:14:26,456 --> 02:14:29,154
I've been waiting
for someone like you,

1362
02:14:29,289 --> 02:14:32,087
someone worthy of me.

1363
02:14:33,023 --> 02:14:36,926
No honor, no rule of law
to sort things out.

1364
02:14:37,061 --> 02:14:40,269
Just two evil bastards
out here in the Wasteland.

1365
02:14:41,735 --> 02:14:45,173
You do this, you do this right,
you become me.

1366
02:14:45,309 --> 02:14:47,841
- I am nothing like you.
- You are me.

1367
02:14:47,977 --> 02:14:49,738
Already dead.

1368
02:14:49,874 --> 02:14:51,875
To feel alive,
we seek sensation.

1369
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:55,483
Any sensation to wash away
the cranky black sorrow.

1370
02:14:56,653 --> 02:14:59,252
And it leaves us for a moment,
but then it comes back,

1371
02:14:59,387 --> 02:15:00,690
and we have to do it all again.

1372
02:15:00,825 --> 02:15:02,249
And we need more,

1373
02:15:02,385 --> 02:15:04,962
and each time we need more
until too much is never enough.

1374
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:08,561
We are the already dead,
Little D.

1375
02:15:09,492 --> 02:15:11,399
[panting]

1376
02:15:12,528 --> 02:15:13,764
You and me.

1377
02:15:19,711 --> 02:15:21,479
[rumbling groan]

1378
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:23,614
[wheezing]

1379
02:15:23,749 --> 02:15:25,072
The question is...

1380
02:15:28,154 --> 02:15:30,913
do you have it in you
to make it epic?

1381
02:15:51,101 --> 02:15:52,487
[History Man]
<i>She took away his voice,</i>

1382
02:15:52,511 --> 02:15:55,806
<i>and they spent the rest
of the day in silence.</i>

1383
02:15:58,281 --> 02:15:59,711
<i>There are those who prefer</i>

1384
02:15:59,846 --> 02:16:02,010
<i>that she did
more than shoot him.</i>

1385
02:16:05,449 --> 02:16:10,161
<i>They claim that she ended him
in ways more fitting.</i>

1386
02:16:13,630 --> 02:16:15,623
<i>They tell
of righteous perversities</i>

1387
02:16:15,758 --> 02:16:18,059
<i>and witty mutilations.</i>

1388
02:16:21,630 --> 02:16:26,804
<i>But this is the truth whispered
to me by Furiosa herself.</i>

1389
02:16:28,772 --> 02:16:30,841
<i>Deep in the Citadel,</i>

1390
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:34,185
<i>high up
in the hydroponic gardens,</i>

1391
02:16:35,354 --> 02:16:38,315
<i>there is a tree
unlike any other.</i>

1392
02:16:38,450 --> 02:16:40,323
[wheezing breaths]

1393
02:16:42,659 --> 02:16:46,857
<i>Its soil is human.
Its nutrients human.</i>

1394
02:16:48,093 --> 02:16:51,158
<i>Maggots debriding
his necrotic flesh.</i>

1395
02:16:52,768 --> 02:16:56,537
<i>It was an echo
growing out of a living being.</i>

1396
02:17:03,976 --> 02:17:06,016
[Furiosa]
<i>This is our first fruit,</i>

1397
02:17:06,151 --> 02:17:07,945
<i>but it's not for you and me.</i>

1398
02:17:09,315 --> 02:17:12,823
<i>Each of us in our own way
will vanish from this Earth.</i>

1399
02:17:12,959 --> 02:17:14,357
<i>And then perhaps...</i>

1400
02:17:15,726 --> 02:17:18,757
<i>some uncorrupted life
will rise to adorn it.</i>

1401
02:17:41,578 --> 02:17:43,078
[thud, echoing]
