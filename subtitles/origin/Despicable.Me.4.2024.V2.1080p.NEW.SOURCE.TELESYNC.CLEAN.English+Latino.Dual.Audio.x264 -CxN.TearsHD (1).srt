00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,066
Huh?

3
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:41,398
Hm.

4
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,314
Stuart.

5
00:00:44,398 --> 00:00:46,522
Illumination!

6
00:02:30,323 --> 00:02:33,323
Phil, Ron, Ralph, stay tuned.

7
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,820
Okay, okay.

8
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,487
Hm.

9
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:44,651
Okay. Our target is Maxime Le Mal,

10
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:47,319
Which the Active Catchers of Charge
must catch.

11
00:02:47,403 --> 00:02:50,487
And believe me, a nasty little guy.

12
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,988
So, there is no room for error.
Got it?

13
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:55,072
Si, boss.

14
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:09,073
O. Phil, Ron!

15
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:10,364
Huh?
-Looka. Looka!

16
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:14,864
Come here, come here!

17
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,153
Jello!

18
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,614
Help me, help me!

19
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:26,698
Huppa!

20
00:03:26,738 --> 00:03:29,368
- Help me!
- Hm, yummy.

21
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:33,698
Children can be cruel,
but Maxime is even more cruel.

22
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:44,861
So, so, so. Look who's there.
There we have Gruser the Loser.

23
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:48,614
So, there you have Maxime Le Mal.
You look...

24
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:51,530
Magnificent out? Yes, I know.

25
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:56,322
What did you think? That I would look like
like a bald loser with a beer belly?

26
00:03:56,406 --> 00:03:59,655
Oops, way ahead of me, non?
-Well...

27
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,906
Oeeeeeh.

28
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:05,491
Ugh.

29
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,199
Laughter is fun, non?

30
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:11,947
Well, do you remember
my friend, Valentina?

31
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:15,200
She was captain
of the Femme Fatale cheerleaders

32
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,739
and the most popular girl
of the school.

33
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:22,448
Yes, I know.
Nice to see you, Valentina.

34
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:24,032
Hmpf.

35
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,408
What am I hearing, Gru?

36
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:33,116
All your dreams of becoming famous
as a villain, which went ... poof-poof?

37
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,072
I don't know if you know,
but I managed to steal the moon.

38
00:04:37,164 --> 00:04:40,581
Really? You mean that moon?

39
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:47,156
Is it on?
May I have your attention please?

40
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,956
Good evening and welcome,
former students of Lycée Pas Bon.

41
00:04:52,908 --> 00:04:56,909
We kick off the festivities
with the announcement of the winner

42
00:04:56,993 --> 00:05:01,325
Of our coveted trophy:
The Golden Former Pupil.

43
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:06,365
And now, I no longer beat around the bush.

44
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,826
This year's winner
of The Golden Former Apprentice is....

45
00:05:11,326 --> 00:05:12,786
Um... Oh!

46
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:16,494
My favorite student, Maxime Le Mal.

47
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:19,410
What, but you can't do that, can you?
-Thank you, thank you.

48
00:05:19,494 --> 00:05:22,786
Merci, merci beaucoup.
Non, there's really no need.

49
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:31,951
Oh, thank you. Thank you... Thank you.

50
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:36,827
You guys probably already know.
I have something very big in the works right now.

51
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:42,203
You know, there was laughter, because as a
kid was always dealing with cockroaches.

52
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:47,495
But I soon saw that cockroaches
are a miracle of evolution.

53
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,826
Wow. Wow.

54
00:05:48,914 --> 00:05:53,330
And I am now able
to harness the power and the speed.

55
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:55,035
And the... What is the word?

56
00:05:55,119 --> 00:06:00,160
The implacability of
the most powerful being in the world.

57
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:05,543
And that makes me indestructible
and unstoppable!

58
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:08,327
Maxime, Maxime, Maxime.

59
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:12,668
Behold the powers of the cockroach.

60
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,454
Oh, oh stop. Stop!

61
00:06:40,546 --> 00:06:44,662
And sad boyfriend of mine,
what do you have to say to this?

62
00:06:44,754 --> 00:06:47,413
Well, I say you...

63
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:51,869
have been arrested
On behalf of the Active Catchers of Charge!

64
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,414
I didn't think so, mon ami.
-O no? Slime grenade.

65
00:06:57,914 --> 00:06:58,914
Oh.

66
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:01,998
Hops.

67
00:07:04,607 --> 00:07:05,607
Ho, ha.

68
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:09,662
Coming in.

69
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:12,454
Stay where you are!

70
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,083
Huh, Huh.

71
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,163
Haaa.

72
00:07:23,687 --> 00:07:25,087
Stay put.

73
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,607
Halt!

74
00:07:32,964 --> 00:07:34,540
Got it.

75
00:07:34,624 --> 00:07:36,124
Non, non, non. Non.

76
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,331
Surely this is impossible. C'est impossible.

77
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:41,208
Hands off me, all of you.

78
00:07:42,464 --> 00:07:44,748
I command you to let go of me.

79
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:48,373
Goodbye, Maxime.
Who's the loser now?

80
00:07:48,457 --> 00:07:50,416
Loser, loser, loser.

81
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,163
Aaaaah!

82
00:08:01,164 --> 00:08:03,376
This is not over!

83
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:08,416
You can't let the AVL
out in front of you, coward.

84
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:11,625
Mark my words.
I'm going to exterminate you, Gru.

85
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:13,833
What...

86
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,002
Um, not creepy, mind you.

87
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:39,878
Hello, everyone.
Gru, what's up?

88
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,082
Yay, Gru.

89
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:44,835
I'm so glad you're here.
-Everything kits at the Gru-tjes?

90
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,959
Look what I taught Guit.

91
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:49,167
Guitje, sit.

92
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:54,798
Oh Guitje, I said "sit.

93
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,835
Well, he's only had
had one lesson, mind you.

94
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:03,459
Maybe we should
practice outside from now on.

95
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,168
There's my darling husband.
Did you bring milk too?

96
00:09:07,612 --> 00:09:12,959
Yes indeed, they had all sorts of things. Almond milk,
soy milk, hemp milk, oat milk,

97
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:17,836
goat milk, chocolate milk, coconut milk,
powdered milk and I have cleansing milk.

98
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:22,132
Do you also have regular milk?
-No, they don't make that anymore.

99
00:09:22,212 --> 00:09:23,461
Ho.

100
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,336
Wait a minute.

101
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:29,376
One, two, three girls, one woman....

102
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:34,797
So something is missing.
-No, I believe we are complete. Yup.

103
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:38,093
Or for that matter? I'm forgetting something. This one here!

104
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:44,801
That's my boy. There he is.

105
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:49,422
Where is daddy's kiss?

106
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,614
Oh, who's a little cranky here?

107
00:09:52,878 --> 00:09:58,005
Even though you are a sourpuss,
you love your daddy.

108
00:09:58,085 --> 00:10:01,669
Go on. Say: Daddy. Daddy.

109
00:10:01,753 --> 00:10:06,586
Of course he loves you, but
he doesn't show it on his face.

110
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:08,754
Or with his body language.

111
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:12,462
Right, Gru Junior? Come on, show daddy
how much you love him.

112
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:16,546
Oh, I do know what makes you happy.

113
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:19,838
Hmmm, Bahama stew.

114
00:10:21,595 --> 00:10:28,422
No. It's from the Bahamas,
very far away. Look, oh, so yummy.

115
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,631
That really has a Caribbean vibe.

116
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,800
See? He loves his daddy.
He shares it.

117
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:43,715
Phil, Ralph, Ron.

118
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,756
Brushing briefly.

119
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:53,384
Polishing.

120
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,801
Thanks, guys.

121
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:16,880
Rattle bum?

122
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:19,057
Bips.

123
00:11:19,801 --> 00:11:22,173
I need to have a word with you.
-Sure, but...

124
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:24,479
There is no time for chatter.

125
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,514
Maxime Le Mal sent a message
sent from his cell.

126
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:33,425
Bonjour, Gru.
I know you're listening, so listen.

127
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:37,474
You think you can humiliate me?
And get away with it? Yes?

128
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:42,134
So don't. If I escape
escape, I will come and take revenge on you, Gru.

129
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,618
But this time I will
not be gentle with you.

130
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,842
And I know where you live.

131
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:53,091
So I would just sleep with one eye open,
because you can't hide.

132
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:55,427
Sleep tight, Gruser.

133
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:02,926
Don't worry, he can't get out of there anyway.
It's a very heavily guarded prison.

134
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,174
Ah, yes, well, um....

135
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:07,551
He escaped yesterday.
-What?

136
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:09,675
Out of our house?

137
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:13,051
Oh no, you think that's super.
It's called a safe house.

138
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,091
And that's fun. And that's safe.
And that's great. And we're going.

139
00:12:17,175 --> 00:12:20,091
You are getting a new room
And a new school.

140
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:23,092
That will be fun, right?
Everything all new. Nice.

141
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:24,468
What about my friends?

142
00:12:24,552 --> 00:12:27,176
You do make new ones.
Probably better ones.

143
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,383
Unbelievable.

144
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:34,884
Yes yes, lots of emotions, different life.
No weeping, hup with those legs.

145
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:36,636
Go ahead, come on.

146
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:49,805
I'm so sorry
That you can't come with me, Guitje.

147
00:12:53,061 --> 00:12:54,177
Are you taking good care of him?

148
00:12:55,621 --> 00:12:56,886
Be nice, Guitje.

149
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:59,726
Don't forget to practice your tricks.

150
00:13:04,385 --> 00:13:07,177
We will be in a few hours
at the safe house.

151
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,723
Mayflower is a lovely little town.

152
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:13,846
A lovely, safe and boring town.
Believe me, this is the best, Gru.

153
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:16,929
What about grandma? What about Uncle Dru?

154
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:19,969
Sorry, no one can know
where you are.

155
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:23,430
Not even the family.
-Every disadvantage has its advantage.

156
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:26,178
You promise to
take care of the other Minions?

157
00:13:26,702 --> 00:13:29,015
Those are sitting high and dry
in the AVL headquarters.

158
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,347
I have big plans for them.

159
00:13:31,431 --> 00:13:33,722
Well, good luck with that.

160
00:13:52,847 --> 00:13:54,764
Now enough is enough!

161
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,680
Silence!

162
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:09,596
You are now on Carl's bus.

163
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:13,140
And Karl is a longtime employee
at the AVL,

164
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:16,016
Who wants to reach retirement age
wants to reach.

165
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:21,224
So here in Karl's bus
you stick to Karl's rules.

166
00:14:22,104 --> 00:14:25,472
No mischief, no shenanigans,
no old-boy crap.

167
00:14:25,556 --> 00:14:26,765
Currant bread?

168
00:14:26,849 --> 00:14:28,765
So this stops.

169
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:33,724
Or you will be introduced to a side
of Karl that you don't want to know.

170
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:36,105
Is that clear, gentlemen?

171
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:38,057
Bazooka!

172
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:51,438
Karl doesn't like this. Hands off.
What are you doing? Don't squeeze! No, no!

173
00:14:57,626 --> 00:15:00,643
We are here.
The town of Mayflower.

174
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:04,934
This safe house has been used for years
to protect our agents.

175
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:09,606
Oh, look at that.
Wow, those lawns, those flowers!

176
00:15:09,682 --> 00:15:13,018
- Wow, that's cool.
- Are we literally going to live here?

177
00:15:13,098 --> 00:15:16,683
Look at that fountain.
-Wow. Fat cool.

178
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:20,142
- Oooh, oooh, is that our house?
- Oh, look at that!

179
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:23,603
- Oh, how beautiful!
- I could get used to this.

180
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:29,643
It looks like there
a princess lives there.

181
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:32,100
And here it is.

182
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:35,192
Your new home.

183
00:15:40,684 --> 00:15:41,684
O.

184
00:15:42,768 --> 00:15:46,604
No fountain.
-I'm sure it will be fun here.

185
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:47,769
Come on.

186
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:52,100
According to Silas, there is a swimming pool
in the garden. Now that's fun, isn't it?

187
00:15:59,229 --> 00:16:03,353
Wow, it's so cold and unsociable.

188
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,354
But in a homely way.

189
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:08,893
Yes, it is according to the standards
of the AVL set up.

190
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:12,645
Little comfort, but a generous enough
for functionality.

191
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:17,477
There is even an automatic
emergency lock. Isn't that fun?

192
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:19,769
Ow, an emergency lock.

193
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,186
Yippee.

194
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:25,693
It has a candy machine.
Too crazy this house!

195
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,898
See.

196
00:16:32,978 --> 00:16:34,398
Ouch.

197
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,355
Hoppa.
-Ha.

198
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:39,814
This is going to be great.
-Beautiful, and now to the point.

199
00:16:39,902 --> 00:16:43,602
For your safety,
you will be given a new identity.

200
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:48,354
Do we really need them then?
-No discussion possible, Gru.

201
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:50,979
Well, you are a salesman
of solar panels.

202
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:54,603
Lucy, you're a hair stylist
in an upscale hair salon.

203
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:58,395
A hair stylist? Yes, jackpot.

204
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:02,980
Did you pick that because I cut my own
hair cut and I'm going to flame in this?

205
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
No.

206
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:09,604
Chet Cunningham?
Ah, that actually sounds nice.

207
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,148
Girls.

208
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:14,027
Cool, I'm Beril.

209
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:17,063
Britney?
-My name is Brie?

210
00:17:17,151 --> 00:17:21,632
Oh come on, there are worse names.
-Yes, like Bea.

211
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:25,896
Yes, Margot. Bea, what a terrible name.

212
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,104
How sad if your name is Bea.

213
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:31,104
Really, I don't know a worse name....

214
00:17:31,944 --> 00:17:33,396
My name is Bea, isn't it?

215
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,649
Yep.

216
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,773
Well, that takes some getting used to.

217
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:42,029
You girls go pick out a room
pick a room, and I'll talk to your parents.

218
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:46,857
Yes, I didn't want to scare the girls,

219
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:50,734
but it is vitally important
that you keep your identities secret.

220
00:17:50,822 --> 00:17:54,649
Gru, I have to ask you,
please don't be Gru-ish.

221
00:17:54,737 --> 00:17:56,441
What do you mean by that?

222
00:17:56,529 --> 00:18:00,774
I'm just saying that you often stand out
in a crowd and no more.

223
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:04,442
You know. Um... Like when you're
cranky and irritable.

224
00:18:04,526 --> 00:18:08,191
And if you make it a little uncomfortable
for everybody.

225
00:18:08,635 --> 00:18:09,858
Yes, you do.

226
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,982
I mean, you know...
-Okay, enough.

227
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:15,067
I don't make people
feel uncomfortable.

228
00:18:15,155 --> 00:18:18,982
I comfort all people,
just like a plum cake.

229
00:18:19,074 --> 00:18:21,066
I am quite manageable.

230
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:28,066
This is not uncomfortable.
You are making it uncomfortable.

231
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:33,443
Gru, you must not stand out. Your family
is in mortal danger. Do you understand?

232
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:38,191
Sure, yes. We understand that. We do
everything for the safety of our family.

233
00:18:38,715 --> 00:18:41,567
Right, beautiful. I'll be in touch
when everything is over.

234
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:46,823
Until then, bringing in
of Maxime Le Mal is our top priority.

235
00:18:47,984 --> 00:18:49,652
Stay safe.

236
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,360
You know, maybe this is
not so bad.

237
00:18:54,444 --> 00:18:58,608
No chasing villains
or dangerous missions, right?

238
00:18:58,692 --> 00:19:01,192
We can be an ordinary family.

239
00:19:01,776 --> 00:19:06,485
And then I finally get to
to some quality time with the baby.

240
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,193
This is going to be really great. Right, buddy?

241
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:10,909
Who grabs your nose? Who...

242
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:13,909
He grabs my nose.

243
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:14,985
Ouch.

244
00:19:15,069 --> 00:19:18,576
He can squeeze hard. That kid is strong.

245
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:29,072
Ah.

246
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,781
Thanks. Need to see you guys.

247
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,822
We're having fun, right?

248
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:15,654
I love you guys.
Thank you, my wonderful army.

249
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:18,307
Maxime is back, yes!

250
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:26,363
A special merci beaucoup to those who
helped me escape from the AVL prison.

251
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,363
Tom and Linda, where are you?

252
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:32,698
Yes, distracting the guards....
Oh, très magnifique.

253
00:20:33,495 --> 00:20:34,907
Now silence!

254
00:20:35,407 --> 00:20:38,491
We make Gru pay for my arrest.

255
00:20:40,174 --> 00:20:45,163
And what better way to do that than by
kidnapping his precious little baby.

256
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:47,531
Oh, I want to have that baby.

257
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:52,448
Oh, Maxime.
-Non, non, wait, wait.

258
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:57,532
Not Maxime. You'll call me
Cockroach Man from now on, huh?

259
00:20:57,616 --> 00:21:01,324
Seems a little obvious,
but it's very obvious. Cool, isn't it?

260
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:06,325
I won't call you by that stupid name,
but I am so in favor of this vicious plan.

261
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:11,073
Well, Gru asked. He humiliated me
humiliated me and in front of the whole school.

262
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:14,117
I had my trophy and all that stuff.

263
00:21:14,202 --> 00:21:17,409
But now the game begins.

264
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:22,658
He may run away like the mouse,
but we find him like the cat.

265
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,749
Game on.

266
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,285
Stop.

267
00:21:29,661 --> 00:21:30,662
Stop.

268
00:21:31,077 --> 00:21:32,201
Stop.

269
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:33,409
Stop!

270
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:37,449
Stop!

271
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:42,034
Okay, here are Chet's scrambled eggs
nice and full of cheese.

272
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:45,410
And Bea's famous bacon,
that spell your name.

273
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:48,706
Please, Britney.

274
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:55,327
Wait. I can't say my
Britney's name. Because then I would be joking.

275
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:56,703
Yes.

276
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:59,327
But we are not allowed to jockey at all.

277
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:03,659
You shouldn't think of it as jockeying.
Just think of it as a form of pretending.

278
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,867
Oh no, I don't.

279
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,451
Ah, a little white lie.
-No.

280
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:11,868
Agnes, I am your father
And I command you to jockey.

281
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:14,076
No.
-Yes, joking.

282
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,659
You are treading on thin ice, young lady.

283
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:18,787
Hmm.

284
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:24,744
Why don't you look more
like your sister, Edith? That one jokes all the time.

285
00:22:24,828 --> 00:22:28,288
I don't.
-See? See? Now she's joking again.

286
00:22:28,368 --> 00:22:30,204
And well too, I must say.

287
00:22:30,288 --> 00:22:33,119
Okay, this is our first day
at Mayflower.

288
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:37,120
And as far as I'm concerned, this is going to be a great
day. Right, Chet Junior?

289
00:22:37,204 --> 00:22:40,368
Woohoe! Mayflower, yoo-hoo!

290
00:22:40,452 --> 00:22:43,868
We're going to be late for karate.
-You have to take Margot to school.

291
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:46,497
- Yippee.
- It must be cool.

292
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:49,204
Hey, you just have to dare to be yourself

293
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:52,913
and then Mayflower will take Chet Cunningham
into his heart.

294
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:55,497
They're going to love him as much
as I do.

295
00:22:56,417 --> 00:23:00,630
And you, little man, you're going to have so much fun
with your daddy.

296
00:23:00,706 --> 00:23:01,578
Mom.

297
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:06,621
Yep, just you and Dad.
Come on, say it then. Dad.

298
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:08,293
Dad.

299
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:14,246
Yes, this will be a fun day.

300
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:30,622
Hup, hup, hup, hup.

301
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:32,037
Huppakee.

302
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:33,831
Okay.

303
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:35,706
No, go!

304
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:40,586
Thank you, guys.

305
00:23:40,666 --> 00:23:43,747
Baby.
-Hup, check, chok, chik, check, check, yes.

306
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,707
- All right, thank you, doll.
- Hi huh!

307
00:23:50,415 --> 00:23:52,371
Look, Margot. The neighbors.

308
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:55,291
Hello!
-Hm?

309
00:23:55,379 --> 00:23:57,872
Come with me. You can do this, Chet.

310
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:03,208
Your new neighbor, Chet Cunningham.

311
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:09,372
Uhuh, Perry Prescott.
What brought you here, Chet?

312
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:10,504
Well...

313
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:11,708
Um...

314
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,541
Solar panels. Yes, that!
I sell solar panels.

315
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:19,417
Are you already participating in the solar revolution?

316
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:23,081
Yes, no. I am already provided for.

317
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:26,081
Good to know.
And what do you actually do, Perry?

318
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:31,749
I have Prescott Motors,
the largest car dealer in the state.

319
00:24:31,841 --> 00:24:34,333
Wow, impressive.

320
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:37,624
This is my daughter Margot.
-Brie, Dad.

321
00:24:38,316 --> 00:24:39,317
Ah, yes.

322
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:43,333
Yes, did I say Margot?
How funny, because I was thinking....

323
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:47,334
I thought of a fish
I had as a child named Margot.

324
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:51,501
He lived in the pond and he died.

325
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,457
Um...

326
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:55,210
Anyway...

327
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:59,918
Um... I'm about to take Brie to
school for her first day.

328
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:02,794
Yeah, I was just about to take
to school, so...

329
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:07,294
Poppy? Hello, Poppy.
What a nice name that is.

330
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:10,666
Would you like to carpool with us?
-No.

331
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:16,399
You can become friends with Brie.
Right? You don't have any friends at all.

332
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,880
Well, nice banter, Chet,
but she has school

333
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,043
and I go with some friends
of mine to the tennis club.

334
00:25:25,135 --> 00:25:27,127
Oe, tennis club. That sounds like fun!

335
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:30,588
If I were to be invited
To a tennis club,

336
00:25:30,672 --> 00:25:33,252
Then I would love that.

337
00:25:34,503 --> 00:25:38,919
Yes ... Well, we really have to get going now,
so nice knowing you, Chet.

338
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,043
Yes, fun chatting! If you ever want to
want to do, we can just chat!

339
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,552
He does start chatting.
-That was painful.

340
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:59,712
Just watch, by this afternoon you will have forgotten
who your old, rotten friends were.

341
00:25:59,796 --> 00:26:02,213
Mm, I'm not so sure about that yet.

342
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:09,213
Really isn't it? Oh my gosh.

343
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:10,753
Not my problem, bro.

344
00:26:12,213 --> 00:26:14,381
Hey honey, you can do this.

345
00:26:14,461 --> 00:26:18,670
You are smart. You're funny.
You don't have to worry, right?

346
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:21,086
They're going to like you.

347
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:23,510
Thank you, Gru.

348
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:26,878
Bye bye.

349
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,346
Oh, let them like you.

350
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:37,922
Hi, Poppy.

351
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:43,174
Um...

352
00:26:45,546 --> 00:26:46,546
Huh?

353
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:50,463
Drive!
-Sorry, mistake. I'm already going.

354
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:52,427
Okay, I'm going already!

355
00:26:54,507 --> 00:26:56,170
Ugh, buttocks.

356
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:18,592
Huh?

357
00:27:23,801 --> 00:27:26,588
All right, gentlemen. Arise.

358
00:27:28,388 --> 00:27:31,133
You may be wondering
What you are doing here.

359
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:32,509
Um, sí.

360
00:27:32,597 --> 00:27:36,509
As you may or may not know,
I had to interrupt my retirement

361
00:27:36,593 --> 00:27:41,672
to lead the project of the
AVL to deal with Maxime Le Mal.

362
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:45,764
And that is why you are here.
I'm looking for volunteers.

363
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:50,633
I need the strongest, the heftiest.
-O.

364
00:27:50,721 --> 00:27:52,089
The fearless.
-Nope.

365
00:27:52,173 --> 00:27:54,758
I look for the best of the best.

366
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:57,049
So, which one of you will it be?

367
00:28:00,765 --> 00:28:02,048
Yes, very good, gentlemen.

368
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:03,050
Huh?

369
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:09,426
The AVL is known
for high-tech weapons and vehicles.

370
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,049
But now we are also developing
high-tech agents.

371
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,510
And I can't imagine better test animals
than you.

372
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:19,303
Test animals, yes!

373
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:22,759
You are the first ones
to test our super serum.

374
00:28:22,843 --> 00:28:27,095
Designed to turn you into
top agents with powers and abilities

375
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,927
that those of mere mortals
exceed those of ordinary mortals.

376
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:35,259
Whether you explode.
We don't know yet.

377
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:36,720
Um, huh?

378
00:28:39,804 --> 00:28:41,887
Hey.

379
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:52,720
Yes.

380
00:28:56,768 --> 00:28:57,768
Yes!

381
00:28:59,327 --> 00:29:00,328
O?

382
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:21,769
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I bring you the Mega Minions.

383
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,593
Cool.

384
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:35,222
Ah, how cute you guys
looking cute. And very cool and scary.

385
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:38,470
It would be even better
With a black belt. Hi-yah!

386
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:39,386
Oh, oh.

387
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,679
I'm going to break a brick with my head.
-That's the way to hear it. Ow.

388
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:47,305
Okay. Have fun. I'm going to get to work.

389
00:29:47,393 --> 00:29:50,846
Beril and Britney, yes?
-Hm.

390
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,178
Will do.
-Okay, bye, mom.

391
00:29:54,262 --> 00:29:55,262
Day.

392
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,139
Got it.

393
00:29:57,223 --> 00:29:58,387
Hi-yah!

394
00:29:58,471 --> 00:29:59,807
In the circle, people.

395
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,554
Hiyah.

396
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:07,431
Show respect for your sensei.
-Yes, sensei O'Sullivan.

397
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,599
Hai!

398
00:30:13,556 --> 00:30:16,683
Boscovitch, did I not order you
to cut that hair?

399
00:30:16,763 --> 00:30:20,331
You look like a sheepdog.
-Sorry, sensei.

400
00:30:21,648 --> 00:30:26,194
Well, we have two newcomers today
who want to start their journey

401
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:28,888
on superness.

402
00:30:29,332 --> 00:30:33,471
You, ukkepuk. Come forward
And tell me your name.

403
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,724
Um...

404
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:36,432
It's Britney.

405
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:38,557
Um...

406
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:40,481
What is my name?

407
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:43,809
You can't.

408
00:30:43,897 --> 00:30:48,848
There is no "can't" in karate.
Ten push-ups after class.

409
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,388
Hey, that's not fair.

410
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:52,348
How-ha.

411
00:30:52,388 --> 00:30:55,641
I wouldn't be mouthing off
To your sensei.

412
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,096
Hiyah!

413
00:30:57,097 --> 00:31:00,933
Well, are you ready to say
your name and to join in?

414
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:03,057
Hmm.

415
00:31:03,141 --> 00:31:05,181
I don't think so.

416
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:09,309
Then sit in the corner
Of shame and reflection

417
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:12,390
And ask yourself what kind of person you want to be.

418
00:31:17,414 --> 00:31:20,890
Good. Am I gonna have
get in trouble with you?

419
00:31:21,334 --> 00:31:24,350
Yes, probably.
-What do you say?

420
00:31:24,434 --> 00:31:29,231
If you think I don't fight with children
fight, you're in the wrong dojo.

421
00:31:37,227 --> 00:31:38,059
Ha!

422
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:40,395
Ouch!

423
00:31:46,232 --> 00:31:48,651
That was for my sister.

424
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:50,058
Huh?

425
00:31:51,483 --> 00:31:55,851
You broke my little toe!

426
00:31:56,351 --> 00:31:58,859
That's going to be a lot of push-ups.

427
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,520
Okay, here comes this.
Hair gel.

428
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,475
Mrs. Cunningham?
-Oh, um, yes, um, hi.

429
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,644
I must say, what a beautiful resume you have.

430
00:32:09,732 --> 00:32:13,060
Oh, what shall I say?
I'm good at what I do.

431
00:32:13,152 --> 00:32:16,061
Well, you are exactly
what we need here.

432
00:32:16,145 --> 00:32:18,777
A lot of demanding divas here
in town.

433
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:27,100
I'm at a loss for words, folks.
Where is what's-her-name? Renée? Rhonda?

434
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:30,769
Melora, how sorry I am.
Rachel is on maternity leave.

435
00:32:30,853 --> 00:32:33,438
What, oh, but you just can't do that, can you?

436
00:32:33,526 --> 00:32:38,353
But you're lucky,
because our Bea here is fantastic.

437
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,522
Perfect. I am sitting in my chair.

438
00:32:41,686 --> 00:32:43,734
Okay missy, you may.

439
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,478
And Melora, what are you in the mood for?

440
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:54,477
What if we wash it
and let it air dry?

441
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:57,102
Experience the power of nature, or so?

442
00:32:57,186 --> 00:33:02,522
No, I've had that style.
It's time for a whole new Melora.

443
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:04,646
I want this.

444
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,062
Wow ... Wow.

445
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,069
Um...

446
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,854
Okay, we'll start with the color?

447
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:15,231
Yes, the color. Because that's where you start.

448
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,603
A little bit of this.

449
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:20,687
Bit of that.

450
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:24,187
And-oh, that's beautiful.
This is not so difficult.

451
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:27,855
Um...

452
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:33,608
What?

453
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:40,064
Is it supposed to smoke?
-Yes, smoking means it works.

454
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:42,564
Huh?

455
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,605
What happens?
-Perfect. Don't panic.

456
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,273
Call the fire department!

457
00:33:59,364 --> 00:34:00,688
Walk, walk, walk.

458
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:03,207
O.

459
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,697
Where do those go?

460
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:10,188
Voilà!

461
00:34:10,272 --> 00:34:11,817
My latest creation.

462
00:34:11,901 --> 00:34:15,605
All my transformation powers
in one handheld design, lol.

463
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:20,106
Oh, it's beautiful. And look at
see that little antenna! That is so cute.

464
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:22,442
It's not supposed to be cute, non.

465
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:25,317
I'm going for intimidating.
Terrifying even.

466
00:34:26,782 --> 00:34:29,566
Now all I have to do is
looking for that walking potato

467
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,234
And his baby is mine!

468
00:34:32,342 --> 00:34:33,942
Check this out here.

469
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:39,526
Wow.

470
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:50,943
No, this is not a joke.
Really, these people here ... Whoa!

471
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,275
Oh, this is really going to be top notch!

472
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:26,192
Okay, Daddy is just completely exhausted.

473
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:29,692
Your diaper is changed. You have your bottle.
Your pacifier.

474
00:35:29,776 --> 00:35:34,821
And here are your balloons.
Look at that, you like those, don't you?

475
00:35:34,909 --> 00:35:37,741
Huh huh, a moment to myself.

476
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:58,698
Hmm.

477
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:14,154
They put a glitter bomb
in my locker.

478
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,326
Adolescents are terrible.

479
00:36:17,322 --> 00:36:18,322
Yes...

480
00:36:18,362 --> 00:36:20,662
Babies are no fun either.

481
00:36:27,278 --> 00:36:28,278
Junior!

482
00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:44,071
Ah, okay, okay.

483
00:36:46,112 --> 00:36:48,364
Dua Lipa prosciutto.

484
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:57,497
Book coverage!

485
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,112
Puste, Ralph.

486
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,028
- Hello, Gru.
- Hello.

487
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:16,779
What, what? Um, what?

488
00:37:19,657 --> 00:37:22,657
Oh, hello, Poppy. Did you perhaps say something?

489
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:27,114
What, um, no. My name is Chet, by the way.
Chet Cunningham.

490
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:30,781
Gru? What? What does that even mean?

491
00:37:34,137 --> 00:37:35,574
That you are not good at lying.

492
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:39,614
Hey, that's not nice.
Ever heard of respect for the elderly?

493
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,991
I have no respect for boomers.
I laugh at them.

494
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:47,322
Is that sometimes
a joke? Did you get that one from the web?

495
00:37:47,406 --> 00:37:48,406
Wow.

496
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:51,407
The web? How old are you?

497
00:37:51,499 --> 00:37:54,867
Well, old enough to know
that you are a nasty, little...

498
00:37:54,951 --> 00:37:55,951
Eh?

499
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:57,951
I would just be careful.

500
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:00,075
What Oeh...

501
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:02,575
You have been a master villain.

502
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,782
That's not me.
I don't even look like that.

503
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:10,782
You obviously have the wrong one in front of you,
because I'm selling...

504
00:38:10,783 --> 00:38:12,830
Um, solar panels.

505
00:38:12,831 --> 00:38:17,575
Oh, don't worry. I'm not going to expose you.
You're going to help me take a crack at it.

506
00:38:17,659 --> 00:38:22,123
We're going to make a plan tomorrow.
-You want to do a squat?

507
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,324
Listen missy, I'm not-
-No, you're listening, old man.

508
00:38:26,408 --> 00:38:32,952
I got you and I swear to you:
there is no mocking me.

509
00:38:33,032 --> 00:38:38,076
Okay, um, yeah well.
But tomorrow is not such a good time.

510
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,408
Bummer for you.

511
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,784
Because this is going to happen.

512
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:47,248
Unless you want the whole world to know
exactly who you are.

513
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:51,789
Gru.

514
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:54,993
What a creep she is.

515
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:08,285
Bello, bello, thank you!

516
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:13,118
Yes!

517
00:39:13,202 --> 00:39:15,286
Hey hey, tap it! Tap it!

518
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:16,370
Yes!

519
00:39:21,502 --> 00:39:22,502
Oh, thank you!

520
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:25,954
Yay...

521
00:39:26,038 --> 00:39:27,410
Ah.

522
00:39:27,494 --> 00:39:28,829
Hey, Jiminy!

523
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,039
No problemo!

524
00:39:42,287 --> 00:39:43,411
Huh?

525
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:44,495
Oh, pfjoew.

526
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:49,287
Oi.

527
00:39:52,663 --> 00:39:54,504
Thank you.
-O.

528
00:39:56,372 --> 00:39:59,080
Okay, okay, quiet now.

529
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:00,412
Quiet!

530
00:40:00,996 --> 00:40:02,121
Thank you.

531
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:05,420
It's time to start training
in the real world.

532
00:40:05,496 --> 00:40:06,835
Liberty, yeah.

533
00:40:06,836 --> 00:40:12,496
And if you do well there,
you will become AVL's new secret weapon.

534
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:14,204
Hey, pomodoro!

535
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,080
La pomodoro, hey!

536
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:21,036
Ugh.

537
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,421
I probably won't
no regrets.

538
00:40:29,585 --> 00:40:32,957
Well,
the painter cancelled.

539
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:35,957
I don't know what...
Good morning, neighbors.

540
00:40:36,045 --> 00:40:40,081
Hello. You're still
me, right Perry?

541
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:42,998
O!
-No. No, no.

542
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:44,414
Yoo-hoo!
-Patsy...

543
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:46,206
Hey, neighbors.
-Patsy.

544
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:52,122
Hoi-eh, I'm Perry's wife Patsy.
-Oh, I'm Bea and this is Chet.

545
00:40:52,214 --> 00:40:55,082
Hi. Hey, you know, seeing you
standing here like this,

546
00:40:55,166 --> 00:40:58,830
then I get one
of my brilliant ideas.

547
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:02,375
Perry is looking for tomorrow
a partner for tennis.

548
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:06,666
I... I don't know. He just
a tennis fanatic.

549
00:41:07,547 --> 00:41:08,207
Not a tennis fanatic?

550
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:11,499
I am an avid tennis fanatic.
I am Mister Tennis.

551
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,878
It is my favorite
Of all the sports and games.

552
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:19,623
With a racket like that and with those balls,
so pretty yellow and hairy.

553
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:25,959
Settled, then. I'll see you two
at the club tomorrow. Toedeloe.

554
00:41:26,047 --> 00:41:28,631
Okay. Toedeloe, that's where we have to go.

555
00:41:30,068 --> 00:41:34,416
And, so you play tennis?
-Yes, yes, I play tennis.

556
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,915
And quite fantastic actually.

557
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:39,123
Well, at least it used to be at summer camp.

558
00:41:39,215 --> 00:41:41,424
Oh, how good. Here you go.

559
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:45,548
Okay, bye. Have fun!

560
00:41:47,175 --> 00:41:48,257
Check it out.

561
00:41:49,961 --> 00:41:51,045
Um, okay.

562
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:53,544
What?

563
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,541
What should... Huh?

564
00:42:18,049 --> 00:42:21,918
Gru. You can't hide, Gru.

565
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,917
Oh, my back. I can't hold it anymore.
How long is this going to last?

566
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:28,501
Well, this takes as long as it takes.

567
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:31,837
Mark my words: Gru is not going to win.

568
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,254
This is not the talent show
from the third grade.

569
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:36,670
Oh, here we go again.

570
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:41,042
Yes, again yes. It was a decisive
moment. Why don't you let me?

571
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:46,211
It was on the night of the show.

572
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:49,547
I had been practicing a song for weeks

573
00:42:49,631 --> 00:42:52,794
from which my classmates
would freak out.

574
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:57,427
I wanted to stand up. Then...

575
00:42:57,503 --> 00:42:58,339
What?

576
00:42:58,427 --> 00:42:59,427
...I heard it.

577
00:42:59,463 --> 00:43:00,963
What Oh.

578
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:11,592
There stood that little jerk
And he did my big number.

579
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:16,088
He had ruined everything.

580
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,464
I couldn't go on after him.
Then I would have been a fool.

581
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:21,380
Like I was imitating him.

582
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:25,627
Maybe it was purely coincidental.
It was just a popular song.

583
00:43:26,152 --> 00:43:29,340
Oh, non, non, non. He knew it.
He did it on purpose.

584
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,672
He loved
to humiliate me.

585
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:35,797
What now?
-Fuel has run out.

586
00:43:35,881 --> 00:43:41,464
There is always something. Why can't I ever
just be nice and bad?

587
00:43:41,544 --> 00:43:43,797
Okay, parking.

588
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,799
Okay, let's see. Just unleaded.

589
00:44:15,883 --> 00:44:18,923
Oe, wow, that's pretty pricey, non.

590
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:22,845
Okay, enter pass and quickly delete.

591
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:24,299
Pass unreadable?

592
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:27,630
Ah, come on.

593
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:31,515
Did you remove it quickly, though?
-Yes, yes, it could hardly be any faster.

594
00:44:38,923 --> 00:44:42,007
Hey, bring me a slush.
It's my slush day.

595
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:47,091
You there. Your stupid device
won't read my card.

596
00:44:47,175 --> 00:44:50,300
Did you remove it quickly?
-Yes.

597
00:44:50,388 --> 00:44:54,840
Well, some do it too fast.
You just have to try again.

598
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:57,468
I don't have time for this!

599
00:44:58,384 --> 00:44:59,799
Okay, wait!

600
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,884
I am trying to destroy my enemy!

601
00:45:03,972 --> 00:45:07,801
So give me 3000 liters on pump four,
fool.

602
00:45:07,885 --> 00:45:11,841
Please, don't hurt me.
-O, but I'm not going to hurt you.

603
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:14,177
What?

604
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:22,802
O.

605
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,009
Look at you.

606
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,425
Much better.

607
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:28,472
And give me a purple slush, you.

608
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:33,261
I'm not paying for that,
just so you know. Lekker puh.

609
00:45:33,341 --> 00:45:35,841
Yes, I am that bad.

610
00:45:41,078 --> 00:45:41,802
Hm.

611
00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,094
Okay, you guys pick
a healthy granola.

612
00:45:45,178 --> 00:45:47,678
This is Guit's favorite muesli.

613
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:51,926
He hasn't forgotten me, has he? Right?

614
00:45:52,434 --> 00:45:55,387
Oh dear, that's not possible at all.

615
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:59,842
You play with Guitje and you dress him up
and you have a podcast.

616
00:45:59,934 --> 00:46:04,803
It's absolutely impossible that he's
forget you. His best friend.

617
00:46:05,803 --> 00:46:07,267
Thanks, Mom.

618
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:14,427
Look, this one has extra marshmallows.
-Double sugared chocolate lumps.

619
00:46:14,511 --> 00:46:15,927
Yes, we'll take those.

620
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:18,596
Okay, what else do we need?

621
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,304
Oh no.

622
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,472
She didn't see anything.
She didn't notice anything.

623
00:46:28,928 --> 00:46:30,842
- What is it?
- Huh?

624
00:46:30,843 --> 00:46:35,804
Oh, nothing at all. Just, um, stretching,
before we move on.

625
00:46:35,888 --> 00:46:40,552
Grocery shopping is the cause of
muscle injuries. Didn't know that, did you?

626
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:47,596
Okay, stretched. Let's go.
Hup hup. Hup, hup, hup.

627
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,344
Okay, the coast is clear...

628
00:46:52,513 --> 00:46:54,013
O.

629
00:46:55,473 --> 00:46:56,513
You.

630
00:46:58,437 --> 00:47:01,473
You did this. Cheater.

631
00:47:01,561 --> 00:47:03,849
Come, girls.
Cleaning crew, aisle nine.

632
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:07,806
Have always wanted to say.
We are hiding here.

633
00:47:07,894 --> 00:47:11,554
What does the madam want from us?
-Madam? No ma'am seen.

634
00:47:14,855 --> 00:47:15,930
Madam!

635
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:18,270
Come on. Get out of here. Faster!

636
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,182
Wow.

637
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,222
You are not a hairdresser.

638
00:47:22,478 --> 00:47:24,055
I'm on to you.

639
00:47:24,147 --> 00:47:26,223
Come back, you.
-I have to get out of here.

640
00:47:43,515 --> 00:47:44,515
Okay.

641
00:47:51,603 --> 00:47:52,603
Come back, you.

642
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:53,975
A, ah o.

643
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:57,600
Ha.
-Ho.

644
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,852
- Yoo-hoo!
- Hey, no, no, no.

645
00:48:01,524 --> 00:48:04,892
You can't just...
Open, open, open!

646
00:48:12,017 --> 00:48:13,057
Wow.

647
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,517
We go.

648
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:21,141
Stop. Come here, you.

649
00:48:26,849 --> 00:48:30,850
That was in the nick of time. Always fun
when shopping with Mom.

650
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:34,356
- You can't do better shopping!
- Now that's life!

651
00:49:06,566 --> 00:49:07,982
Perfecto.

652
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:10,395
Poppy.

653
00:49:10,479 --> 00:49:12,815
Poppy.

654
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:19,527
I don't see her, Junior.
-Bove you, smartass.

655
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:20,859
You are too late.

656
00:49:21,983 --> 00:49:25,395
How do I get up there?
-With the trampoline.

657
00:49:25,479 --> 00:49:26,480
Huh?

658
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,484
Here we go.

659
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:48,356
Au, au, au, au, au.

660
00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:06,068
Here I am, Poppy Prescott, villainess.

661
00:50:06,985 --> 00:50:09,817
Take a seat, Gru.
-Okay, I'll take...

662
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:12,565
Okay.

663
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:14,145
Okay, why am I here?

664
00:50:14,237 --> 00:50:19,190
Because, like you,
I am a born rogue.

665
00:50:19,274 --> 00:50:24,022
And now we need to talk
about our squat.

666
00:50:24,106 --> 00:50:27,194
Crack, please. You are only a child.

667
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:31,607
Great villains start early.

668
00:50:31,691 --> 00:50:35,315
Didn't you steal the crown jewels
at age twelve?

669
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:39,070
I was a lot younger than that.
Sorry, but you are not me.

670
00:50:39,146 --> 00:50:43,022
I will most likely be
much better than you.

671
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,522
Check this out here.

672
00:50:45,606 --> 00:50:49,315
Hey, is that my old school?
-Bingo.

673
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:52,814
Which I expertly recreated
with glue and popsicle sticks.

674
00:50:53,646 --> 00:50:59,091
And what we're going to steal there for a while is:
the school mascot.

675
00:50:59,363 --> 00:51:02,239
Do you want to steal Lenny?
-I do.

676
00:51:02,315 --> 00:51:05,524
Lycée Pas Bon was always
my dream school.

677
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:08,855
And this crack will look so good
in my rogue log.

678
00:51:08,947 --> 00:51:10,983
This is a very bad idea.

679
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:14,024
Have you ever seen a honey badger?

680
00:51:14,108 --> 00:51:16,276
They are nasty, mean monsters.

681
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:20,277
They literally eat bees and cobras
at breakfast.

682
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:22,357
That doesn't do honey badgers any good.

683
00:51:22,441 --> 00:51:24,856
No no, I'm really not going to help you.

684
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:30,365
Well, that's the pity of blackmail.
You don't really have a choice.

685
00:51:44,941 --> 00:51:46,817
Come along. Come along!

686
00:52:00,533 --> 00:52:01,534
Okay.

687
00:52:02,402 --> 00:52:03,861
O.

688
00:52:03,862 --> 00:52:05,986
Ah. Um, Tim?

689
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,650
Tim, go, go, go.

690
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:13,817
Chihuahua.

691
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:21,571
No!

692
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:22,695
Stronger!

693
00:52:24,111 --> 00:52:25,111
You the best!

694
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:29,611
Le salami!
-Le salami!

695
00:52:30,195 --> 00:52:32,863
Suppository!

696
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,028
Give here!

697
00:52:38,116 --> 00:52:39,819
Hey, police!

698
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:40,903
No problemo.

699
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:43,987
Hi-yah.

700
00:52:50,028 --> 00:52:52,028
Um, piña colada.

701
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,235
Huh?

702
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:00,536
Help!

703
00:53:03,324 --> 00:53:05,820
Please, can you help me?
-Ah, si, si.

704
00:53:12,196 --> 00:53:13,528
Huppa.

705
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:16,529
Hey, all good. Ciao.

706
00:53:16,613 --> 00:53:17,865
Huh?

707
00:53:19,453 --> 00:53:21,537
Grease, come on.
-Hey.

708
00:53:29,161 --> 00:53:31,370
Thank you, thank you!

709
00:53:32,822 --> 00:53:34,282
Ugh, a smooch.

710
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:39,367
A smoochie.

711
00:53:39,655 --> 00:53:40,907
Woah.

712
00:53:43,654 --> 00:53:45,537
O!

713
00:53:46,369 --> 00:53:47,578
Help!

714
00:53:47,654 --> 00:53:50,238
Bazooka!

715
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:08,655
Oh, um...

716
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:18,539
Hey hey. Stop, stop. Police.

717
00:54:28,492 --> 00:54:30,076
Ciao bellos.

718
00:54:34,956 --> 00:54:38,949
Because of them my car is wrecked.
-They destroyed the cafe.

719
00:54:39,041 --> 00:54:41,657
- Get out you guys!
- They are destroying everything!

720
00:54:42,181 --> 00:54:45,205
I've had it with superheroes.
-Yes, we grab them.

721
00:54:48,364 --> 00:54:50,040
Get in. O.

722
00:54:50,908 --> 00:54:52,324
Bazooka!

723
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:54,869
- Boo!
- Yes, off you go.

724
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:58,825
Gentlemen, our experiment failed.

725
00:54:58,913 --> 00:55:01,868
You are officially sidelined.

726
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:03,701
Playing outside!

727
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:05,701
Huh? Um, no?

728
00:55:19,617 --> 00:55:21,701
Wow.

729
00:55:21,785 --> 00:55:22,869
There it is.

730
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:35,078
The castle, the gargoyles.
Unbelievable that I am here.

731
00:55:41,787 --> 00:55:43,494
Okay.

732
00:55:47,582 --> 00:55:50,826
Come on. Then it's done.
Ron, my equipment.

733
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:51,750
Voilà.

734
00:55:51,834 --> 00:55:53,954
Don't lose sight of him.

735
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:58,035
If you need anything, I've got his
bottle, diapers, favorite pacifier....

736
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:00,251
Hurry up. Come on, come on.

737
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:12,495
And now we are going to cut the glass
with my...

738
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:17,538
Diapers? What?
Am I being taken by the nose sometimes?

739
00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:19,079
Motel la piñata!

740
00:56:19,791 --> 00:56:22,704
Hey, guys. Guys. Guys.

741
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:25,744
Guys, where's that other bag
with my tools?

742
00:56:25,828 --> 00:56:27,164
In le balloon.

743
00:56:28,372 --> 00:56:29,204
Um...

744
00:56:29,288 --> 00:56:30,288
Oops.

745
00:56:32,748 --> 00:56:33,996
What, huh...

746
00:56:36,704 --> 00:56:38,873
Okay, let's see what I have here.

747
00:56:38,957 --> 00:56:40,205
Um...

748
00:56:40,293 --> 00:56:42,293
Come on, come on, come on.

749
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:43,373
Aha!

750
00:56:49,749 --> 00:56:50,789
Hm, thank you.

751
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:56,121
Apple egg.

752
00:57:08,665 --> 00:57:09,665
Huh?

753
00:57:14,002 --> 00:57:16,166
That's Mr. Friendly.

754
00:57:16,666 --> 00:57:18,121
Stupid kids.

755
00:57:20,498 --> 00:57:22,206
No, no, no!

756
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,207
I hate my job.

757
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,291
Pfiew.

758
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:40,751
Ha, ha, ha.

759
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:49,539
Oh, that's Dr. Destructo.
Just a kid.

760
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:52,332
There is the original helmet
of Killer Driller.

761
00:57:52,776 --> 00:57:54,540
Come on. Stay with it for a while.

762
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:04,999
Diaper.

763
00:58:05,875 --> 00:58:07,251
Huppa.
-Yes.

764
00:58:19,877 --> 00:58:22,752
I have to have something that...
Something that I can...

765
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,292
Like this?

766
00:58:24,776 --> 00:58:25,797
Nice.

767
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:29,793
Yes!

768
00:58:34,342 --> 00:58:36,585
We're in.
-Wait.

769
00:58:36,669 --> 00:58:37,793
No, no, no.

770
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:39,669
Baby powder.

771
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:40,961
Yes, si, si, here.

772
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:47,750
Wow.

773
00:58:47,834 --> 00:58:50,641
You know, the most important thing
in a squat

774
00:58:50,642 --> 00:58:53,758
is that you remain constantly aware
of possible danger.

775
00:58:54,754 --> 00:58:56,046
La, la tiramisu.

776
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:58,834
- Come here.
- Hey.

777
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:01,501
Junior. Junior, come back here.

778
00:59:04,006 --> 00:59:07,842
And what are you up to now?
-I'm working on it.

779
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:13,502
No, don't touch anything.

780
00:59:13,586 --> 00:59:16,003
No, no, no, no, no.

781
00:59:18,779 --> 00:59:21,295
Yes, well done, Junior. Good job.

782
00:59:25,003 --> 00:59:28,503
Oh, he's having fun.
-Yes, too much fun.

783
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:31,756
Stop.

784
00:59:31,844 --> 00:59:35,672
Here you go, Junior.
Daddy needs to steal a honey badger.

785
00:59:38,756 --> 00:59:40,504
Okay.

786
00:59:41,628 --> 00:59:44,128
I know they keep Lenny
keep here at night.

787
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:50,253
And if I'm not mistaken, there should be
a hidden switch somewhere.

788
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:51,629
Aha.

789
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,048
Yes.

790
00:59:57,221 --> 00:59:58,221
Ow.

791
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:08,380
I'm going to give him this.

792
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,980
When he is knocked out,
we open the cage.

793
01:00:11,049 --> 01:00:13,921
That downy devil
Sleeps like a baby as long as

794
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:21,638
Okay, he's still asleep.

795
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:28,714
Mama mia!

796
01:00:32,922 --> 01:00:34,722
Now my leg sleeps.

797
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:43,130
Hey! Hey!

798
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:47,299
Gru, what should we do?

799
01:00:47,967 --> 01:00:48,967
No!

800
01:00:52,888 --> 01:00:55,839
Oh, no. I'm ruining our squat.

801
01:00:58,051 --> 01:00:58,883
What?

802
01:00:58,971 --> 01:01:00,632
Who will dare?

803
01:01:06,547 --> 01:01:07,883
Intruders.

804
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,223
Intruders!

805
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:25,800
Wake up!

806
01:01:26,924 --> 01:01:27,924
No!

807
01:01:33,885 --> 01:01:34,885
What?

808
01:01:37,885 --> 01:01:38,925
Hmm.

809
01:01:42,301 --> 01:01:43,593
Aw.

810
01:01:43,677 --> 01:01:45,053
Aw.

811
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:47,093
No. No.

812
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:52,258
Come on, we have to go.

813
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:56,801
Ouch! Come on.

814
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:02,342
Intruders,
you're bullying the wrong principal.

815
01:02:03,058 --> 01:02:05,050
Here we go, come on. Come on.

816
01:02:10,598 --> 01:02:12,013
Hup, hup, hup.

817
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,594
Come on.

818
01:02:17,682 --> 01:02:19,970
Ugh, you won't get away with this!

819
01:02:42,851 --> 01:02:45,767
Prepare for the fury
of Überschlecht.

820
01:02:49,144 --> 01:02:50,720
Ah, baby butt ointment.

821
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:53,680
Oh no, oh no! Stop, stop, stop!

822
01:02:55,853 --> 01:02:57,145
Oh dear.

823
01:02:59,768 --> 01:03:03,761
Come back again, you. I want my Lenny!

824
01:03:07,601 --> 01:03:09,680
How can we get out of here?

825
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,013
Follow me.

826
01:03:11,845 --> 01:03:12,845
Get in.

827
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:17,016
Come on, come on, come on!

828
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:21,761
Mr. Friendly.

829
01:03:44,686 --> 01:03:50,514
I must say: that was without a doubt
the coolest night of my life.

830
01:03:50,598 --> 01:03:53,147
Unbelievable that we succeeded.

831
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:57,939
I don't deny it, that was pretty fun.

832
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:01,603
Thanks, Ron.

833
01:04:01,683 --> 01:04:02,975
Whew, o la la.

834
01:04:03,063 --> 01:04:06,895
And thank you, for everything.

835
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:13,263
Oh, and hey, no worries.
Your secret is safe with me, partner.

836
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:14,723
Thank you.

837
01:04:14,811 --> 01:04:16,871
Goodbye.

838
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:22,103
Your daddy did quite nicely, didn't he Junior?

839
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:29,892
Si, si, si, go, go.

840
01:04:30,763 --> 01:04:35,056
Oh hello, Maxime.
How is my favorite pupil doing?

841
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:39,100
I think you and I are looking
for the same person.

842
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:42,933
And I know very precisely where he is.

843
01:04:50,185 --> 01:04:52,641
Thank you, director Überschlecht.

844
01:04:52,725 --> 01:04:56,981
We got him.
Valentina, to Mayflower.

845
01:04:57,058 --> 01:04:58,518
My pleasure.

846
01:05:04,061 --> 01:05:04,893
Ah.

847
01:05:04,981 --> 01:05:06,310
Check it out.

848
01:05:07,562 --> 01:05:09,102
Okay, yes. Yes.

849
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:11,310
It's all coming back.

850
01:05:13,394 --> 01:05:14,934
Oops.

851
01:05:15,018 --> 01:05:16,565
Okay.

852
01:05:16,566 --> 01:05:17,809
See you later.

853
01:05:18,565 --> 01:05:21,101
Say: Bye, Daddy and Mommy.
-Have fun!

854
01:05:21,185 --> 01:05:23,226
Take good care of yourself.

855
01:05:23,314 --> 01:05:25,394
Bye, huh!
-Bye.

856
01:05:26,274 --> 01:05:26,558
Bye!

857
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:30,311
Hey, Cunninghammetjes.
-Ehm, hey, Poppy.

858
01:05:30,795 --> 01:05:34,018
Our parents have a play date,
which is pretty cute.

859
01:05:34,102 --> 01:05:36,558
I thought you guys might want to
wanted to do?

860
01:05:36,650 --> 01:05:38,687
Oh, yeah, sure. Come on in.

861
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:41,519
The party can begin, folks.

862
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:45,735
She's nice.
-Yes, everyone thinks so.

863
01:05:46,352 --> 01:05:47,520
Nice.

864
01:05:47,608 --> 01:05:50,727
And have you ever seen
seen a honey badger?

865
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:57,852
Wow.

866
01:05:57,944 --> 01:06:00,559
Okay, they don't make a mess of it.

867
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:03,796
There are my favo new neighbors.

868
01:06:04,236 --> 01:06:04,312
Hi.

869
01:06:04,396 --> 01:06:09,776
Oh, what a cool vibe.
You guys look like a bunch of pros!

870
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:13,353
Yes, but we are not.

871
01:06:13,877 --> 01:06:16,064
Perry and the boys are waiting for you
on the job.

872
01:06:16,144 --> 01:06:18,312
We set out to find the clubhouse.

873
01:06:18,396 --> 01:06:22,152
And you tell me where you got
got that insane outfit.

874
01:06:27,777 --> 01:06:29,397
To this, Chet.

875
01:06:30,237 --> 01:06:30,521
Hello.

876
01:06:31,065 --> 01:06:32,065
Okay.

877
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:36,937
Flip, Jip, Chet. Chet, Flip, Jip.
-Hello boys.

878
01:06:37,021 --> 01:06:38,605
Hello.
-How are you, Chet?

879
01:06:38,689 --> 01:06:39,729
Okay.

880
01:06:41,153 --> 01:06:43,982
Chet here is going to show us
how to do it.

881
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:46,146
Right?

882
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,898
Um... Hmm.

883
01:06:48,982 --> 01:06:52,230
I'll make that guy
complete in.

884
01:06:52,314 --> 01:06:53,730
Okay.

885
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:04,731
So what?

886
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,155
Okay, here goes.

887
01:07:18,983 --> 01:07:21,694
Huh, you can't be serious.

888
01:07:22,938 --> 01:07:24,567
Okay, okay.

889
01:07:25,527 --> 01:07:26,607
Better?

890
01:07:32,276 --> 01:07:33,568
What!

891
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:34,816
Huh?

892
01:07:34,904 --> 01:07:36,231
That doesn't count.

893
01:07:36,315 --> 01:07:37,815
And... What?

894
01:07:37,903 --> 01:07:39,527
You can't just...

895
01:07:40,608 --> 01:07:42,528
This is ridiculous.

896
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:44,524
Hey!

897
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,524
Thank you, Ron.

898
01:07:59,525 --> 01:08:00,525
Hey, no!

899
01:08:03,233 --> 01:08:04,565
Come and get it.

900
01:08:04,657 --> 01:08:06,734
Aw, he's so cute.
-Wow.

901
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:09,317
This is the funniest doggie of all time.

902
01:08:10,321 --> 01:08:11,741
I'll go.

903
01:08:21,802 --> 01:08:25,317
Oh hello, little girl. Is your daddy home?

904
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:29,109
Sorry, I'm not allowed
talking to strange people.

905
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:34,818
I'm not a strange person.
-Well, you do look strange.

906
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:35,902
O.

907
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,318
Who is there?

908
01:08:37,803 --> 01:08:43,150
I don't know.
But she's old and smells like brussels sprouts.

909
01:08:46,659 --> 01:08:48,195
Okay, I'm coming already.

910
01:08:52,803 --> 01:08:53,803
Oh no. Um...

911
01:08:54,527 --> 01:08:55,783
I'll be right back.

912
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:01,027
Is there anything I can do for you?
-Well, I hope so.

913
01:09:01,115 --> 01:09:03,112
I am a friend of Gru's.

914
01:09:03,612 --> 01:09:05,028
Well...

915
01:09:05,112 --> 01:09:07,196
There isn't, so...

916
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,275
Oh, never mind, you know.

917
01:09:10,151 --> 01:09:12,284
I'll wait.

918
01:09:15,072 --> 01:09:16,780
Huh? What? No, ouch!

919
01:09:18,244 --> 01:09:20,745
Tell me when you're ready.

920
01:09:20,821 --> 01:09:21,821
Huh?

921
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:23,821
Hm?

922
01:09:28,244 --> 01:09:30,696
...so instead
it became Maui.

923
01:09:30,784 --> 01:09:36,568
So you understand, Perry and I are no longer
no longer welcome on the island of Oahu.

924
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:37,737
Honestly.

925
01:09:38,613 --> 01:09:40,404
- Honey...
- Oh, happy.

926
01:09:41,244 --> 01:09:42,824
The children. We have to leave. Now.

927
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:47,153
Thank you. Bye.

928
01:09:47,245 --> 01:09:48,945
We were discovered.
-What?

929
01:09:49,029 --> 01:09:50,993
Call Silas.
-O no.

930
01:10:04,406 --> 01:10:05,406
Oe, bella.

931
01:10:11,238 --> 01:10:12,406
Nope.

932
01:10:13,246 --> 01:10:14,282
Bazooka!

933
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:28,862
Gru is in danger.

934
01:10:28,954 --> 01:10:33,031
We have an emergency, folks.
My retirement is officially over.

935
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:35,531
Collect the Mega Minions.

936
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:46,363
Huh, Pomodoro!

937
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:53,740
Huh?

938
01:10:53,824 --> 01:10:56,156
Ha. Pomodoro!

939
01:11:07,993 --> 01:11:08,993
Hey.

940
01:11:10,117 --> 01:11:12,077
Bello, busy bee.

941
01:11:13,201 --> 01:11:14,576
Aw.

942
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:15,577
Huh?

943
01:11:16,249 --> 01:11:17,617
Pomodoro!

944
01:11:21,618 --> 01:11:22,866
Yeehaa!

945
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:23,950
Huh?

946
01:11:24,786 --> 01:11:25,910
Pomodoro!

947
01:11:28,365 --> 01:11:30,865
Pomodoro! Yiehaa!

948
01:11:30,949 --> 01:11:32,785
Yippa, yippa!

949
01:11:35,577 --> 01:11:36,577
Huh?

950
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:37,870
Wow!

951
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:39,618
Yeah!

952
01:11:40,618 --> 01:11:41,950
Huh, O...

953
01:11:48,950 --> 01:11:50,537
Well...

954
01:11:50,538 --> 01:11:53,202
Your father has been naughty.

955
01:11:53,290 --> 01:11:55,619
Incredibly naughty.

956
01:11:56,811 --> 01:11:59,826
He stole something
That I would like to get back.

957
01:12:04,703 --> 01:12:06,203
Director Überschlecht?

958
01:12:06,995 --> 01:12:07,867
O.

959
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:11,535
I know you have my Lenny.
So give it back.

960
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:12,535
Ouch, ouch!

961
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,995
That's actually a very funny story.
-Cup close.

962
01:12:16,075 --> 01:12:18,952
I don't want to hear excuses.
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

963
01:12:19,036 --> 01:12:20,784
Come on, tough guy.

964
01:12:20,868 --> 01:12:23,744
Okay, I'm really not
fight with an old lady.

965
01:12:23,828 --> 01:12:24,952
Oh no?

966
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:28,413
Well, I'll kick your ass
that you'll remember for a long time.

967
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,412
What?

968
01:12:32,123 --> 01:12:33,659
Address.

969
01:12:37,744 --> 01:12:38,828
Yeah, go!

970
01:12:39,832 --> 01:12:43,833
Girls, watch out. Over here.
Stay low all of you!

971
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:47,579
Hey. Stop it, lady.

972
01:12:56,537 --> 01:12:58,581
Ah, girls!

973
01:12:58,669 --> 01:13:01,576
Stop it!
-Let go of him.

974
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:02,625
Take it!

975
01:13:06,869 --> 01:13:08,082
Take it!

976
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,537
Now we're going to go in there
And look for that baby.

977
01:13:14,538 --> 01:13:15,707
What?

978
01:13:19,286 --> 01:13:23,747
Oh, jackpot, huh.
-Maxime, this is too easy.

979
01:13:25,255 --> 01:13:26,679
Come on, little bébé.

980
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:27,955
Join Maxime.

981
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:30,039
Yes, koetsjie, koetsjie....

982
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:31,871
Ai, Maxime...

983
01:13:31,963 --> 01:13:33,247
You little brat...

984
01:13:33,331 --> 01:13:36,078
Things are swinging for you, little man.

985
01:13:37,086 --> 01:13:38,294
Got it.

986
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:41,371
Yes!

987
01:13:43,415 --> 01:13:44,415
What?

988
01:13:50,295 --> 01:13:54,079
Wait. Where's the baby? Where's the baby!

989
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,207
Junior?

990
01:13:58,836 --> 01:14:00,296
Lucy!

991
01:14:00,372 --> 01:14:02,815
Go get the baby!

992
01:14:05,296 --> 01:14:05,580
Maxime.

993
01:14:05,672 --> 01:14:07,543
Say au revoir, Gru.

994
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:12,248
Oh, and don't worry, because he's going to be
very happy with his new daddy.

995
01:14:12,336 --> 01:14:15,541
Look at him.
Oh, he loves his new daddy.

996
01:14:15,629 --> 01:14:17,041
Junior!

997
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:25,921
Get in.

998
01:14:26,965 --> 01:14:28,749
We have to deliver a baby.

999
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:37,960
We got him.

1000
01:14:38,036 --> 01:14:39,459
O.

1001
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:41,832
Who is going to be a cockroach?

1002
01:14:41,912 --> 01:14:42,744
Ouch!

1003
01:14:42,832 --> 01:14:46,165
Let go. Those are very sensitive.

1004
01:14:46,253 --> 01:14:47,665
You wriggling worm....

1005
01:14:47,745 --> 01:14:48,745
Oh.

1006
01:14:49,452 --> 01:14:50,496
Iew.

1007
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:54,452
You don't mean that.
You're piping all over my cockpit.

1008
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:59,749
Valentina, bring me
the cockroach ray.

1009
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:04,693
There they are.

1010
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:07,709
I go off on it.

1011
01:15:08,669 --> 01:15:10,418
Here we go.

1012
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:18,831
Woah, woah, woah, woah.

1013
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,127
What is that?

1014
01:15:28,499 --> 01:15:29,415
Hello.

1015
01:15:29,499 --> 01:15:31,247
Ah, Gru.

1016
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,171
A little closer.

1017
01:15:35,755 --> 01:15:37,211
Yes, almost.

1018
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:40,834
Turn them off.

1019
01:15:51,919 --> 01:15:53,835
You're doing a great job.

1020
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:00,920
Put it on, partner.

1021
01:16:17,881 --> 01:16:19,921
Hey, I don't see anything.

1022
01:16:35,422 --> 01:16:36,462
Junior.

1023
01:16:38,589 --> 01:16:41,797
Don't worry, Gru. The baby's okay.

1024
01:16:41,881 --> 01:16:43,505
See for yourself.

1025
01:16:46,457 --> 01:16:47,958
Oh, Junior.

1026
01:16:48,046 --> 01:16:53,005
And so now he belongs to me.
Isn't that so, Maxime Junior?

1027
01:16:53,753 --> 01:16:59,466
Together we are going to make mischief, mess
kicking. And have so much fun with it.

1028
01:17:01,046 --> 01:17:04,923
And the best part is: He hates you.
He really does.

1029
01:17:05,007 --> 01:17:07,091
Release my son.

1030
01:17:07,175 --> 01:17:11,130
No, I didn't think so.
The fun is really just getting started now.

1031
01:17:21,672 --> 01:17:24,631
Look what a coward
your old daddy is, huh?

1032
01:17:39,004 --> 01:17:40,004
Huh?

1033
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:55,548
You're going too far, Maxime.
So give me my son.

1034
01:17:55,632 --> 01:17:58,756
That's what I said, right? He's my son now.

1035
01:17:58,836 --> 01:18:00,752
Huh? Huh...

1036
01:18:03,589 --> 01:18:04,589
Ow.

1037
01:18:10,257 --> 01:18:15,965
Watch your step, Gru. It's a
thingy. Now if only you could fly, huh?

1038
01:18:23,010 --> 01:18:24,510
Release.

1039
01:18:35,803 --> 01:18:37,967
This ends now.

1040
01:18:38,051 --> 01:18:40,470
Say goodbye to Daddy.

1041
01:18:43,663 --> 01:18:44,663
O.

1042
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:50,178
It's okay, Junior. Daddy loves you.

1043
01:19:15,012 --> 01:19:17,096
Come back, you. Bad baby.

1044
01:19:17,172 --> 01:19:18,508
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

1045
01:19:18,596 --> 01:19:20,428
Get off me, brat.

1046
01:19:21,096 --> 01:19:23,096
Meet the fury of the...

1047
01:19:23,173 --> 01:19:24,173
Hi-yah!

1048
01:19:46,221 --> 01:19:48,846
See? Not a scratch.

1049
01:19:48,926 --> 01:19:50,593
Huh, what?

1050
01:19:50,673 --> 01:19:53,424
Salami!

1051
01:19:55,425 --> 01:19:57,466
Pastrami!

1052
01:19:58,673 --> 01:20:00,425
Non, non, non, non.

1053
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:01,881
Prosciutto!

1054
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:06,510
What?
Prosciutto!

1055
01:20:06,598 --> 01:20:08,266
Ow, ow, ow. nasty.

1056
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,465
Nice try. If I...

1057
01:20:17,634 --> 01:20:19,426
Antipasti.

1058
01:20:27,307 --> 01:20:29,723
Gru.
-Junior.

1059
01:20:34,051 --> 01:20:35,467
Yes!

1060
01:20:35,555 --> 01:20:38,467
Unbelievable.
-Are you guys okay?

1061
01:20:43,516 --> 01:20:45,140
Dad.

1062
01:20:48,968 --> 01:20:50,512
Aw.

1063
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,636
O.

1064
01:20:51,724 --> 01:20:53,140
My boys.

1065
01:20:54,184 --> 01:21:00,515
You know? Today was just
a huge roller coaster of feelings.

1066
01:21:03,676 --> 01:21:05,304
Um, Gru?

1067
01:21:06,148 --> 01:21:07,600
May we go back home now?

1068
01:21:12,265 --> 01:21:14,709
Okay, look at this.

1069
01:21:15,096 --> 01:21:16,220
Yay.

1070
01:21:16,308 --> 01:21:19,849
Thank you, Dr. Nefario.
As good as new.

1071
01:21:19,977 --> 01:21:23,101
No job too small, or too crazy.

1072
01:21:24,101 --> 01:21:26,310
Day day.
-Day.

1073
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:35,514
Hey.

1074
01:21:35,558 --> 01:21:37,186
Are you okay, honey?

1075
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:42,151
Agnes, there is someone here for you.

1076
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:50,935
Guitje?

1077
01:21:55,226 --> 01:21:56,266
Guitje.

1078
01:21:59,559 --> 01:22:01,766
Have you been practicing your tricks?

1079
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:04,058
Okay, lying dead.

1080
01:22:09,099 --> 01:22:10,431
Yes!

1081
01:22:10,519 --> 01:22:14,896
That was...kind of scary.
-Yes. Kind of was.

1082
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:17,671
Guitje.

1083
01:22:17,887 --> 01:22:19,139
Hey, I um...

1084
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:21,771
Be right back.
-O. Okay.

1085
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,020
I need to take care of something.
-Yes.

1086
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:26,896
See you later, buddy.

1087
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:28,188
Love you, honey.

1088
01:22:34,808 --> 01:22:35,848
O.

1089
01:22:35,936 --> 01:22:38,144
How are you doing, Maxime?

1090
01:22:38,228 --> 01:22:42,229
What do you come here for anyway, Gru?
Make fun of me? Well?

1091
01:22:42,313 --> 01:22:46,185
Laugh? No, no, no, I just need
just need to get something off my chest.

1092
01:22:46,269 --> 01:22:50,185
And it's about the talent show
from the third grade.

1093
01:22:50,937 --> 01:22:54,476
Look ... Honestly ...

1094
01:22:54,477 --> 01:22:57,853
I had stolen your song.
-What?

1095
01:22:57,937 --> 01:23:02,229
I knew it. I knew it
wasn't a coincidence. Sneaky liar.

1096
01:23:03,813 --> 01:23:05,977
And?
-And what?

1097
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:08,105
And where are your excuses?

1098
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:11,269
What will we experience now?
I just gave that one.

1099
01:23:11,713 --> 01:23:16,562
Oh, non, non, non. Those were not excuses.
You just wanted to rub it in.

1100
01:23:16,646 --> 01:23:19,561
Unbelievable. You picked my song.

1101
01:23:19,645 --> 01:23:24,686
I did that to get back at you because
you pulled down my pants at the gala.

1102
01:23:24,774 --> 01:23:30,271
And by the way, you could have gone up after me.
It's not my fault you were scared.

1103
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:33,478
You were afraid because I was a topper.

1104
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:39,107
Me afraid? I'll sing you out whenever you want
And with two fingers in your nose.

1105
01:23:40,063 --> 01:23:41,687
I would still like to see that.

1106
01:23:41,771 --> 01:23:45,900
Wherever, whenever.
Speak up, mon ami.

1107
01:23:56,604 --> 01:23:58,520
Oh yes.

1108
01:24:10,816 --> 01:24:11,856
Come on.

1109
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:28,437
Yes!

1110
01:24:37,893 --> 01:24:39,313
Oh, yeah.

1111
01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:43,858
Come on, rock.

1112
01:26:09,316 --> 01:26:10,680
Oh yes!

1113
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:19,081
Bello?

1114
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:21,774
Bello?

1115
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:44,983
Um...

1116
01:26:49,735 --> 01:26:52,067
Oh, strudel.

1117
01:28:01,574 --> 01:28:04,282
Hoppa. Hoppa.
