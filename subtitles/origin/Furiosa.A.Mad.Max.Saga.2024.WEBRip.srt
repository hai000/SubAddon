1
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:21,329
<i>Triple-zero,
what is your emergency?</i>

2
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:22,473
<i>9-9-9, what's your emergency?</i>

3
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:24,050
<i>9-1-1, what is your emergency?</i>

4
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:26,386
<i>No one knows
what's true anymore.</i>

5
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:28,731
<i>It's not the end
of the world, but you can see...</i>

6
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,026
<i>Power grid has collapsed.</i>

7
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>Currency is worthless.</i>

8
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:32,691
<i>Cities are burning.</i>

9
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:34,029
<i>Pestilence and pandemics.</i>

10
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:35,398
<i>Catastrophic heat.</i>

11
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:36,934
<i>We're actually
running out of water.</i>

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,701
<i>Why are you
hurting these people?</i>

13
00:00:39,836 --> 00:00:41,966
<i>Getting close to
the terminal freak-out point.</i>

14
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:45,341
<i>Mankind has gone rogue,
terrorizing itself.</i>

15
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,184
<i>Gangs are marauding
like locusts across the land.</i>

16
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,780
<i>The earth is sour.</i>

17
00:00:57,916 --> 00:00:59,256
<i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

18
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:00,818
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

19
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:15,433
<i>As the world falls around us,</i>

20
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:18,407
<i>how must we brave its cruelties?</i>

21
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,742
This one's for me.

22
00:01:56,774 --> 00:01:57,814
I'll get that one for you.

23
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:00,278
We should go back now.

24
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:01,615
We've come too far.

25
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:05,421
Furiosa!

26
00:02:09,192 --> 00:02:10,192
Hey, Vulture.

27
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:12,330
Shh! Not so loud.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,328
Have you ever seen so much meat?

29
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:16,762
Stay very still.

30
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:20,595
Meat.

31
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:29,346
Valkyrie, be invisible.
Still as a rock till I get back.

32
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,078
Be invisible.

33
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,015
Careful.
Careful with the head.

34
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:08,451
That spine's mine.

35
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,190
Cut right there.

36
00:03:30,306 --> 00:03:31,369
Hear that?

37
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:26,062
Get on! Get on!

38
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:33,305
Furiosa! They took Furiosa!

39
00:05:23,749 --> 00:05:24,889
I'll come with you.

40
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,523
No, they need you here.

41
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,298
The stars be with you.

42
00:06:33,756 --> 00:06:36,087
Snipers!
We got snipers.

43
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,358
Lone rider.

44
00:08:31,606 --> 00:08:32,643
She fouled us.

45
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,344
She bit through it.

46
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:41,847
Hey! What are you doing?

47
00:08:41,982 --> 00:08:43,379
Hey, give it. Give it. Give it!

48
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:55,193
That's the Thunderbike.

49
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:56,997
That's the Thunderbike!

50
00:09:06,844 --> 00:09:08,712
- I thought you crippled it.
- I did!

51
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,474
Who's coming for us?

52
00:09:14,886 --> 00:09:17,415
Who is... who is that?
Is that your pa?

53
00:09:18,351 --> 00:09:19,882
Is that your father? Who...

54
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,187
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

55
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:28,968
Ditch the girl!
That's all he wants.

56
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:30,767
What do we tell Dementus?

57
00:09:31,699 --> 00:09:32,699
We got horse meat.

58
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:34,133
It proves nothing.

59
00:09:34,268 --> 00:09:37,802
But the girl, once he sees her,
he's gonna ask,

60
00:09:37,938 --> 00:09:39,072
"Where did she come from?"

61
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:40,767
And we're gonna be the ones
to tell him.

62
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:43,238
No one's gonna scum us anymore.

63
00:09:43,373 --> 00:09:44,881
No one's gonna scum us anymore.

64
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:47,645
No one's gonna scum us anymore!

65
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,117
That piece of filth!

66
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:22,142
- Whoo-hoo!
- We're gonna make it.

67
00:11:23,112 --> 00:11:25,343
We're gonna make it!

68
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:49,598
I got news for Dementus.
Dementus!

69
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:54,569
What do you got here, Toe Jam?
All by yourself.

70
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,242
I speak only to Dementus.

71
00:11:58,912 --> 00:12:00,008
No. Hands off.

72
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:01,143
Untie it.

73
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:04,019
I found it. She's mine.

74
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,259
Hands off.

75
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:11,093
It's strong. What a dilly, eh?

76
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,299
- She's mine.
- Where did you find it?

77
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:13,323
- Give it back.
- Where?

78
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,325
- Where did you get it?
- Give her back.

79
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:17,435
Give her to me.
I'll take her to him.

80
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,870
She's from a place of abundance.

81
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:22,840
What are you talking about?

82
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,770
A place of abundance!
It's got everything!

83
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:28,170
Where?

84
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:30,712
I speak only to Dementus.

85
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:31,848
Where are you from?

86
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:37,415
Where are you from?

87
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:41,185
Where did you find her?

88
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:44,625
My lips, Dementus's ear.

89
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,326
My lips. Dementus.

90
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,429
Good girl.

91
00:13:25,027 --> 00:13:28,071
The original
JRL Cycles Lucky Seven

92
00:13:28,206 --> 00:13:31,809
was powered by a seven cylinder
radial aircraft engine,

93
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:36,747
with a swept capacity
of 2,800cc's,

94
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:40,647
110 horsepower,
160 pounds of torque.

95
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:41,782
Dementus.

96
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:47,287
Dementus. Look what I found.

97
00:13:53,863 --> 00:13:54,899
Who do we have here?

98
00:14:01,034 --> 00:14:02,535
What's your name?

99
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:04,366
What do they call you?

100
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:06,504
She's from a place of abundance.

101
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,210
- May I?
- Mm-hmm.

102
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:30,895
A healthy,
well-nourished full-life.

103
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,233
Flawless.

104
00:14:37,867 --> 00:14:40,472
Tell us where
you're from, child. Eh?

105
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:42,437
Tell your friend.

106
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:45,246
It's got everything.

107
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:48,777
How do you know that?

108
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:55,355
A Roobilly told me.

109
00:14:56,655 --> 00:14:58,424
He said he saw it
with his own eyes.

110
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:00,529
Hm.

111
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:01,724
And where is he?

112
00:15:04,329 --> 00:15:05,794
Let's hear from Toe Jam.

113
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,507
Bring him in.

114
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,938
This place, where you found her,
it was amazing, right?

115
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:21,451
It had everything, right?
Water, food, everything.

116
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:24,956
Tell me.

117
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:33,324
He's choking.

118
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,423
Well, hang him upside down.

119
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,330
Downside up.

120
00:15:40,837 --> 00:15:42,033
There you go.

121
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:45,873
Draw a map.

122
00:15:46,274 --> 00:15:48,639
Draw an arrow. Draw an arrow!

123
00:15:53,784 --> 00:15:55,316
Show us! Show us!

124
00:16:09,994 --> 00:16:11,864
Now, you have had
a hard day, haven't you?

125
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,169
An awful day.

126
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,370
You must be exhausted.

127
00:16:18,235 --> 00:16:20,907
There's only one thing I need
you to do and that is rest.

128
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:22,751
You don't have to
tell us anything.

129
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:24,745
You don't have to say a word,
I promise.

130
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,149
Just rest.

131
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:29,477
Tomorrow, I'll take you home.

132
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:31,590
I'll follow the tracks
that brought you here

133
00:16:31,614 --> 00:16:33,123
and I'll take you home.

134
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:37,754
Take her, feed her, wash her.

135
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,998
Use our best drinking water.

136
00:16:43,766 --> 00:16:45,199
You two.

137
00:16:45,334 --> 00:16:46,697
Keep an eye on her,
keep her safe.

138
00:16:46,832 --> 00:16:48,600
Don't let any
of these brutes near her.

139
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,202
Hey, what you got there?

140
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,558
Snapper. Snapper!

141
00:18:30,334 --> 00:18:31,439
Ma!

142
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:36,411
Please. I'm a mother, too.

143
00:18:39,777 --> 00:18:41,779
I will say nothing, not a word.

144
00:19:13,853 --> 00:19:16,110
Stop! Stop her!

145
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:21,621
- Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!
- Shoot!

146
00:19:33,665 --> 00:19:34,799
It's not my fault.

147
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:37,505
We've lost her!

148
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,094
Good, we're good.

149
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:28,587
You're bleeding.

150
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:31,922
Do you hear that? Come, quick.

151
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,568
How are they tracking us?

152
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,304
Ride to high ground.
Hide yourself well.

153
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,999
If I don't find you in one day,
go home.

154
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:17,307
Ma, I...

155
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,751
Take your bearings
from the sun and stars.

156
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,655
When there is wind,
use it to cover your tracks.

157
00:21:20,808 --> 00:21:22,248
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Furiosa!

158
00:21:22,272 --> 00:21:24,672
You are Vuvalini,
you'll do as I ask.

159
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,245
Whatever you have to do,
however long it takes,

160
00:21:31,181 --> 00:21:33,423
promise me
you'll find your way home.

161
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,459
Plant this seed.

162
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:38,956
Protect the Green Place.

163
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:42,927
Give me this one gift. Promise.

164
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,217
The stars be with you.

165
00:22:38,084 --> 00:22:39,654
Go around!
Gotta go around!

166
00:22:41,191 --> 00:22:42,789
Find a way around!

167
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:30,031
Ma!

168
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,567
Ma!

169
00:23:33,543 --> 00:23:34,870
- Ahh...
- Tell me!

170
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,342
She's your mother. Perfect.

171
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:39,417
Where are you from?

172
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:41,248
Tell me!

173
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:42,453
Ma!

174
00:23:44,186 --> 00:23:46,451
Tell me where you came from
and we will cease and desist.

175
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:49,117
Furiosa!

176
00:23:49,253 --> 00:23:50,558
All you have to do...

177
00:23:50,694 --> 00:23:53,520
All you have to do
is just point.

178
00:23:53,655 --> 00:23:57,028
Point me in the right direction
and I'll take you home.

179
00:23:57,995 --> 00:24:00,262
No, no, no. Don't look away.

180
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,471
We mustn't look away.

181
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,541
You had your chance.

182
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,579
History Man,
a Word Burger, please?

183
00:24:10,146 --> 00:24:11,146
Tears.

184
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,980
Human tears.

185
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:15,517
The secretions of the lacrimal
gland containing oils,

186
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,916
salts, proteins,
and stress hormones.

187
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,489
The tears of joy
and those of sorrow

188
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,250
have different
chemical compositions.

189
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:24,858
Yes. Sorrow is more...

190
00:24:26,054 --> 00:24:27,861
piquant, zesty.

191
00:25:15,845 --> 00:25:17,141
Why would you run from me?

192
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:22,212
Now your followers must fight
over who gets to kill you.

193
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:24,842
Now, I would've welcomed you.
Every one.

194
00:25:24,949 --> 00:25:26,216
I woulda brought you in.

195
00:25:26,351 --> 00:25:28,592
You coulda been a part
of this great horde.

196
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:32,061
Now, we have a problem.

197
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:36,226
There are 20 of you,
but only five bikes.

198
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,261
How do we choose?

199
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:40,995
Who's got the goods,
the bollocks, the testes

200
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,804
to ride with Dementus?

201
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:46,137
You're gonna have to show me
who you are.

202
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:50,744
Yes?

203
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,979
Because today
we dance to Darwin.

204
00:25:55,115 --> 00:25:59,221
Today, we do
The Five Bike Teddy.

205
00:25:59,356 --> 00:26:03,022
Ready, setty, go!

206
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:30,437
You don't have to watch
if you don't want to.

207
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:33,283
You may wanna close your eyes.

208
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:41,929
You know,
you could hold this if you want.

209
00:26:44,195 --> 00:26:46,629
It belonged to my little ones.

210
00:26:47,332 --> 00:26:49,464
Why don't you
just keep him safe?

211
00:27:00,676 --> 00:27:04,815
Lady and gentlemans,
start your engines.

212
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,144
Lizard mince
and human blood sausage.

213
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,760
Can you write?

214
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:22,191
I can teach you.
Muscle up your memory.

215
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,833
You could become a History Man.

216
00:28:31,136 --> 00:28:32,875
Make yourself invaluable,

217
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:36,076
and Dementus
will look after you.

218
00:29:21,253 --> 00:29:23,052
<i>Astronavigation.</i>

219
00:29:23,922 --> 00:29:28,257
<i>A determination of one's course
by reference to the stars</i>

220
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,999
<i>and other celestial bodies.</i>

221
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,537
Red! Red!

222
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:44,014
Are we curious, boss?

223
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,410
Well, let's go have a look.

224
00:30:07,034 --> 00:30:08,465
Is this Halvalla?

225
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:10,401
Am I in Valhalla?

226
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:12,170
What's Valhalla?

227
00:30:12,305 --> 00:30:14,401
Valhalla's
"The Hall of the Slain."

228
00:30:14,536 --> 00:30:16,411
A paradise for dead heroes.

229
00:30:16,547 --> 00:30:17,606
Good for you.

230
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,261
We're looking for a place
of abundance.

231
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,108
What's abundance?

232
00:30:21,477 --> 00:30:23,821
Abundance, plentifulness.

233
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,824
Having a copious quantity
of something.

234
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,189
Co... What's "copus quantity"?

235
00:30:31,324 --> 00:30:33,056
A lotta stuff.
A lotta good stuff.

236
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:34,191
The Citadel.

237
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:35,298
The what-a-del?

238
00:30:35,934 --> 00:30:36,960
It's where I was birthed.

239
00:30:37,096 --> 00:30:38,361
It's got everything.

240
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:40,696
A humongous amount
of fresh water.

241
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:42,237
And green stuff.

242
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:47,376
Mountains of pro-juice
and veggies and... and water.

243
00:30:48,112 --> 00:30:50,045
And where would one
find this Citadel?

244
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:53,448
That way maybe.

245
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:54,583
What are these?

246
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,811
That is sky blood.
It called you to me.

247
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:49,428
Behold the might of Dementus!

248
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,296
The Red Dementus

249
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:57,766
and his Congress of Destruction.

250
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:02,107
He is here to lay siege on you.

251
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:05,609
Listen carefully to his words.

252
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,681
All of you.

253
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:17,786
All who protect and honor
this magnificent Citadel,

254
00:33:19,059 --> 00:33:20,993
you have a choice.

255
00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:23,330
A very attractive choice.

256
00:33:25,264 --> 00:33:26,965
I want your leaders.

257
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:32,242
I want those
who hold dominance over you.

258
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,510
Bring me your leaders
and throw them down.

259
00:33:37,146 --> 00:33:38,681
Throw them down,
and you'll avoid

260
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,243
more suffering and sorrow.

261
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,384
They exploit you.
They enslave you.

262
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,220
They wash their feet
in your sweat and blood

263
00:33:47,356 --> 00:33:50,186
and they give you
nothing in return.

264
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,154
Listen to this truth.

265
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,636
Big shots rule only
because you choose to follow.

266
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:01,670
The power is with you.

267
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,067
You are free to choose.

268
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:06,042
Come to me.

269
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,712
Come to me
with your pain and burden,

270
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:10,840
and I will double your grub.

271
00:34:10,975 --> 00:34:14,046
Food and water for everyone,
as much you like.

272
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:16,142
We will share the wealth.

273
00:34:16,277 --> 00:34:20,656
You will rule with me in
the splendor of a new Wasteland.

274
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:36,068
Adorable.

275
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:42,741
I'm afraid for you, sweetheart.
Really afraid.

276
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:46,576
'Cause Big Jilly here is gonna
scoop you out, both ends,

277
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,812
mush it up
and feed it back to you.

278
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:51,546
But that ain't nothing compared
to what Mr. Norton here

279
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,320
is dreaming of doing to you.

280
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:56,126
'Cause Mr. Norton
really hates big shots.

281
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,289
- Then there's Mr. Harley.
- G'day, mate!

282
00:34:58,424 --> 00:35:01,297
Mr. Davidson, Rizzdale Pell

283
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:04,959
and a thousand other
mad bastards coming after you,

284
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:08,061
and there ain't nothing
I can do to stop 'em.

285
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:18,973
The Immortan has a request.

286
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,816
Among all his warriors
assembled here,

287
00:35:22,951 --> 00:35:24,451
choose one.

288
00:35:25,747 --> 00:35:27,888
Why would I do that?

289
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,386
For this negotiation
to go further,

290
00:35:30,522 --> 00:35:33,521
you must choose at random.

291
00:35:33,656 --> 00:35:36,298
Any War Boy. Just one.

292
00:35:37,629 --> 00:35:40,029
What if I choose not to choose?

293
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:43,030
Then you'll never know
the truth.

294
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:47,500
My Smeg will choose.

295
00:35:47,635 --> 00:35:50,543
Yes!

296
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:55,311
Okay.

297
00:36:09,594 --> 00:36:10,594
Nope. To the right.

298
00:36:42,866 --> 00:36:45,763
You are awaited.

299
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,937
Witness me!

300
00:36:50,073 --> 00:36:52,165
Witness!

301
00:37:00,182 --> 00:37:01,746
Immorta!

302
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:07,720
Among us
are 972 devout warriors.

303
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:12,152
Any one of them, if chosen,
would've done the same.

304
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:17,493
Each would die historic
for the Immortan Joe.

305
00:37:18,229 --> 00:37:20,696
- That's why you're fools.
- You're the fool!

306
00:37:20,831 --> 00:37:23,732
You're all fools
for coming here.

307
00:37:30,574 --> 00:37:33,943
I am Scrotus.

308
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,649
I am Rictus.

309
00:37:38,785 --> 00:37:42,325
We are the sons
of the Immortan Joe.

310
00:37:43,853 --> 00:37:47,055
And now we're going to kill you.

311
00:38:24,197 --> 00:38:25,197
Hey!

312
00:38:53,194 --> 00:38:54,194
I gotcha.

313
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,362
<i>When things
go bonkers, you have to adapt.</i>

314
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:29,997
You, same as me.

315
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:31,133
They're here.

316
00:39:32,431 --> 00:39:33,568
We're tough.

317
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,998
You're a tender little hound.

318
00:39:37,134 --> 00:39:39,106
A War Rig. Fully loaded.

319
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,341
It's from
the Citadel, all right.

320
00:39:41,477 --> 00:39:43,545
It's got the Immortan's mark.

321
00:39:51,982 --> 00:39:54,754
Food and water for guzzolene.

322
00:39:56,754 --> 00:39:58,593
It beats scavenging.

323
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:02,388
This is our destiny.

324
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:05,028
We are indeed
in the land of opportunity.

325
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:12,502
Watch this.

326
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,418
All hail Dementus!

327
00:41:33,553 --> 00:41:36,086
Dementus!

328
00:41:37,823 --> 00:41:40,756
Fuel for all, enough for months.

329
00:41:40,892 --> 00:41:43,292
Thisis truly a great day.

330
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:45,931
Yeah, well, I'm about to make it
a whole lot greater.

331
00:41:46,066 --> 00:41:48,538
Who are you?
Remove your helmet and jacket.

332
00:41:50,935 --> 00:41:52,832
I take orders from The Octoboss.

333
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:53,967
Huh?

334
00:41:57,776 --> 00:41:59,511
Yeah, do what he says.

335
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:03,014
Uh-uh...
Questioning my boss-ority.

336
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:10,989
Okay.

337
00:42:14,155 --> 00:42:15,356
All right, that's good.

338
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:18,799
Right. Go on.

339
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:21,065
Cover yourself in this.

340
00:42:24,207 --> 00:42:25,207
That's it.

341
00:42:26,606 --> 00:42:27,808
Come on. Come on.

342
00:42:30,476 --> 00:42:31,476
Good?

343
00:42:32,776 --> 00:42:34,045
There ya go.

344
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,511
Choose ten of your men.
The balder the better.

345
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:43,224
Mortifiers.

346
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,424
Settle down.

347
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,519
Who wants to be a War Boy?

348
00:43:28,699 --> 00:43:30,470
What?

349
00:43:30,605 --> 00:43:32,645
<i>The rig's coming back.
I think they're under attack.</i>

350
00:43:52,924 --> 00:43:54,697
Do we open the gates?

351
00:43:55,993 --> 00:43:57,458
No. Something's off.

352
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,634
I'm gonna have to slow down.

353
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:05,098
No. Faster. Go faster.

354
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:06,440
They won't open the gate.

355
00:44:06,575 --> 00:44:07,941
They're not buying it.

356
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:15,141
Shoot them.

357
00:44:15,253 --> 00:44:16,283
What?

358
00:44:16,419 --> 00:44:17,445
Make it real.

359
00:44:19,621 --> 00:44:20,656
What'd he say?

360
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,615
He wants us to make it real.

361
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,456
What are you doing?

362
00:44:31,062 --> 00:44:33,199
No, no. No, no, no!

363
00:44:33,768 --> 00:44:37,168
You're scum, Dementus. Scum!

364
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:41,975
Open the gates.

365
00:44:42,576 --> 00:44:43,878
Open the gates!

366
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:35,930
Open the gates.

367
00:46:03,954 --> 00:46:04,954
Back off.

368
00:46:05,626 --> 00:46:06,626
Get off.

369
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:10,767
Give this to Immortan Joe.

370
00:46:11,961 --> 00:46:12,961
Catch.

371
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,302
Dementus wants to talk.

372
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,146
Are you sure?

373
00:46:29,282 --> 00:46:31,249
Yes. Let him come.

374
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,820
Body search, no weapons.

375
00:46:34,955 --> 00:46:37,558
Whatever he wants, we'll listen.

376
00:46:37,694 --> 00:46:40,159
Then kill him on the spot.

377
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:56,711
Calm down.

378
00:46:57,744 --> 00:46:58,744
Calm down.

379
00:47:05,089 --> 00:47:07,517
The Red Dementus commends you
on your lifestyle

380
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:11,454
and for agreeing to these
trade negotiations.

381
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:19,731
If we're not back safe
by sunset,

382
00:47:19,867 --> 00:47:21,068
we blow up Gastown.

383
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:27,976
This is how you save Gastown.

384
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:45,224
And the six-figure code exists
only in the brain of Dementus.

385
00:47:49,363 --> 00:47:51,891
He wants double.
Double of everything.

386
00:47:52,026 --> 00:47:54,361
One full tank of water
for half a tank of guzzolene.

387
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:56,198
Can't do that. Not possible.

388
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,006
Then he gets a spike in the nut.

389
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:01,872
Double the mothers' milk
and double the hydroponics.

390
00:48:02,008 --> 00:48:03,737
Double the spuds.

391
00:48:03,872 --> 00:48:05,915
Double the maggot mash
and the roach gruel.

392
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,106
My boys need all the protein
they can get.

393
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:12,581
Please. Give him what he wants!

394
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:16,420
The Wasteland won't sustain it.
Run the numbers.

395
00:48:18,157 --> 00:48:20,692
Please, my Immortan. My brother.

396
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,527
Make up your mind.

397
00:48:25,659 --> 00:48:27,596
Can't hold this much longer.

398
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,797
Let Rictus do it, Dad.

399
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,512
I'll squeeze
the code out of him.

400
00:48:33,536 --> 00:48:35,044
- Here, take it. Take it.
- Huh?

401
00:48:41,684 --> 00:48:42,710
Oh, you idiot.

402
00:48:44,513 --> 00:48:45,778
I've forgotten the numbers.

403
00:48:45,914 --> 00:48:47,213
Wait, wait, wait.

404
00:48:47,348 --> 00:48:49,718
Wait!

405
00:48:49,854 --> 00:48:52,621
Yep, it's in there,
got it, got it, got it, okay.

406
00:48:54,825 --> 00:48:57,031
The pleasure flushed them
clean out of my head.

407
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,372
Don't ever do that again, comrades.

408
00:48:58,396 --> 00:48:59,936
I'm a man with a fragile brain.

409
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:03,869
Who's that?

410
00:49:07,472 --> 00:49:11,838
That... is my daughter,
Little D.

411
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:13,774
Little Dementus.

412
00:49:16,314 --> 00:49:17,813
She looks nothing like you.

413
00:49:17,949 --> 00:49:19,590
Yes, well, she has
her mother's perfections,

414
00:49:19,614 --> 00:49:20,823
and none of my deficiencies.

415
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:22,256
Where's the mother?

416
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:25,359
Magnificent woman.
Fierce, intelligent.

417
00:49:25,495 --> 00:49:28,430
Taken so cruelly protecting
this little one from marauders.

418
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:29,988
She looks pale.

419
00:49:30,758 --> 00:49:33,432
You look pale. She's perfect.

420
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:35,602
Not like the genetic absurdities
you have for sons.

421
00:49:37,306 --> 00:49:40,305
Well, she's pale
because I take her blood,

422
00:49:40,441 --> 00:49:42,774
for blood pudding
that I prepare for him.

423
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:44,343
And who are you?

424
00:49:45,777 --> 00:49:49,150
Well, I'm the Organic Mechanic.
All things therapeutic.

425
00:49:49,285 --> 00:49:52,754
Now, make no mistake,
she is a full-life.

426
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,783
Untouched by man or disease.

427
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,953
Would you like to stay here
in the Citadel?

428
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:02,465
Eh?

429
00:50:03,498 --> 00:50:05,032
If I let you stay and you grow

430
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,528
to become a strong,
healthy woman,

431
00:50:06,664 --> 00:50:08,467
you could become
one of our wives.

432
00:50:09,036 --> 00:50:10,532
No, she's my daughter.

433
00:50:10,668 --> 00:50:12,839
It will be
a royal intermarriage.

434
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:14,371
The bonding of dynasties.

435
00:50:14,507 --> 00:50:16,474
Her whole life
I have protected her,

436
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:18,348
from the sun, the wind,
every lecherous gaze.

437
00:50:18,372 --> 00:50:19,372
No.

438
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:22,082
You'll be bonded by blood.

439
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:23,976
No! She's not for sale,
she's mine.

440
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:26,682
What say you, child?

441
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:30,052
She hasn't spoken
since her mother's tragic end.

442
00:50:30,188 --> 00:50:31,489
Very poignant.

443
00:50:42,431 --> 00:50:44,205
Is he your father?

444
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,511
No.

445
00:50:56,150 --> 00:50:57,878
He slaughtered my mother.

446
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:02,047
True, that is true.

447
00:51:02,183 --> 00:51:03,915
And I can tell you
it made this child tough.

448
00:51:04,051 --> 00:51:05,518
Tough enough
to survive all sorrows

449
00:51:05,653 --> 00:51:06,661
that may come her way.

450
00:51:06,797 --> 00:51:08,588
I did that for her.

451
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:10,066
I did that for her.

452
00:51:14,765 --> 00:51:17,199
I will increase
your shipment of water.

453
00:51:17,335 --> 00:51:18,772
But only by a third.

454
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,367
I will increase your food
by a quarter.

455
00:51:21,503 --> 00:51:23,244
Potatoes only.

456
00:51:23,379 --> 00:51:26,113
You'll get your delivery
once every ten days,

457
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,784
but only if my War Rigs
return safely

458
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,417
full of high-grade guzzolene.

459
00:51:34,052 --> 00:51:35,052
Deal.

460
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:41,394
And... I will take this girl,
who is not your daughter.

461
00:51:42,425 --> 00:51:44,595
And also, him.

462
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:48,203
Otherwise, it's war.

463
00:52:30,177 --> 00:52:33,512
You behave, I'll behave.

464
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:35,678
I'll protect Gastown
from all treachery.

465
00:52:35,814 --> 00:52:38,846
It will be as impenetrable
as this Citadel.

466
00:52:38,981 --> 00:52:41,920
Stability born
from a world of chaos.

467
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:44,655
You. Me. We.

468
00:52:48,422 --> 00:52:52,366
Henceforth, I will be addressed
as "The Great Dementus."

469
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,204
Beloved ruler of Bikerdom.

470
00:52:56,138 --> 00:52:58,464
Lord Guardian of Gastown.

471
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,541
Gotta go, gotta go.
Don't want Gastown to go boom.

472
00:53:03,643 --> 00:53:06,038
What a day.
What a deal. What a day.

473
00:53:06,173 --> 00:53:07,880
Beautifully played, boss.

474
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:10,780
Peak Dementus! Eh? Eh?

475
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,753
It's all right.
You'll be all right.

476
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:54,020
<i>All right.</i>

477
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:58,225
Now, shove that little beauty
out into the world.

478
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,932
Come on.

479
00:54:00,068 --> 00:54:01,068
Here it comes.

480
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:03,338
I can see its head.

481
00:54:06,806 --> 00:54:09,102
Good girl. Good girl.

482
00:54:11,075 --> 00:54:13,507
Oh, yeah.

483
00:54:13,643 --> 00:54:15,310
You're very clever.

484
00:54:15,445 --> 00:54:16,445
One last shove.

485
00:54:19,082 --> 00:54:20,618
One more, one more.

486
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:23,622
Very good.

487
00:54:26,789 --> 00:54:28,957
Is it a boy? Is it a boy?

488
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:34,336
More or less.

489
00:54:35,696 --> 00:54:37,229
Sorry, boss.

490
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,105
I will give you a full-life!

491
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,409
I know that I can.

492
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,011
Three strikes, you're out.

493
00:54:44,147 --> 00:54:45,644
Rictus.

494
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,951
Please, let me stay.

495
00:54:51,086 --> 00:54:52,746
Don't fret, love.

496
00:54:52,881 --> 00:54:55,291
You'll make an excellent milker.

497
00:56:28,745 --> 00:56:29,847
What's this?

498
00:57:17,696 --> 00:57:20,764
Rictus. You lose something?

499
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:23,135
Just looking.
Just looking around.

500
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:24,299
What for?

501
00:57:24,435 --> 00:57:26,134
Nothing.

502
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:28,341
No. Don't lie to me.
You're up to something.

503
00:57:28,477 --> 00:57:30,512
- What is it?
- Nothing.

504
00:57:31,878 --> 00:57:33,343
Well, what're you
doing here then?

505
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,181
I thought I saw someone running.

506
00:57:36,317 --> 00:57:37,578
Running away.

507
00:57:38,314 --> 00:57:40,819
But it was just a dream.
An annoying dream.

508
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,703
Brake!

509
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:35,203
Dogman. The loose cable!
Secure it!

510
00:58:40,179 --> 00:58:44,014
Save the bucket!
We need that bucket!

511
00:58:56,693 --> 00:58:58,231
You go down.

512
00:58:58,366 --> 00:59:00,360
No. Someone small.

513
00:59:01,433 --> 00:59:02,538
You!

514
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:05,332
Come on.

515
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,040
No. Him.

516
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:13,070
You've got a lot of ticker, boy.

517
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:14,874
Brake Man.

518
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:24,818
You're the new dogman.

519
01:00:50,744 --> 01:00:52,945
Line up. Line up.

520
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:55,816
Juva-jub-jub.

521
01:00:58,282 --> 01:01:00,581
Welcome to the house
of holy motors.

522
01:01:00,717 --> 01:01:03,654
We're gonna make us something
mighty from this boneyard,

523
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,124
from all these body parts.

524
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:08,955
Two hefty V8 engines,
a chassis for a Prime Mover,

525
01:01:09,091 --> 01:01:11,766
2,857 found objects.

526
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,032
And we are going
to put this all together.

527
01:01:14,167 --> 01:01:17,037
We are going to build
something beautiful.

528
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:19,836
And we're doing this for who?

529
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:21,436
- Immortan Joe.
- Who?

530
01:01:21,571 --> 01:01:23,710
Who will raise us
from the ashes of this world.

531
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,771
Are you ready
to be Black Thumbs?

532
01:01:25,907 --> 01:01:27,014
Immorta!

533
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:27,839
You?

534
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,150
Immorta!

535
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:30,444
How about you?

536
01:01:32,145 --> 01:01:33,486
Speak his name.

537
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:35,317
He don't speak. He's mute.

538
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:39,361
Where have I seen you before?

539
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,653
He's a dogman. Very useful.

540
01:01:42,957 --> 01:01:44,327
Scrawny.

541
01:01:44,963 --> 01:01:46,924
Oi! We've got work to do.

542
01:01:47,794 --> 01:01:50,200
We're going to build ourselves
a War Rig.

543
01:01:50,336 --> 01:01:53,099
The finest piece of grunt
in the Wasteland.

544
01:01:53,235 --> 01:01:55,702
Bigger, stronger, faster!

545
01:01:55,838 --> 01:01:57,379
Immorta!

546
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,941
Immorta! Immorta! Immorta!

547
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:22,326
We are going to build
a contraption

548
01:02:22,462 --> 01:02:23,502
that will defend the rear.

549
01:02:23,565 --> 01:02:26,166
We will call it
"The Bommyknocker."

550
01:02:26,301 --> 01:02:28,007
Is that the Praetorian Jack?

551
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,381
He looks lucky.

552
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:40,118
He done the most runs
on the Fury Road.

553
01:02:41,187 --> 01:02:43,257
And brung back the booty
every time.

554
01:02:43,392 --> 01:02:45,552
Hey. Prae Jack.

555
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:26,967
What's going on?

556
01:03:36,745 --> 01:03:38,880
Why so shy? It's just piss.

557
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:47,455
They were right,
the crazy brothers.

558
01:03:47,590 --> 01:03:49,053
She is a mighty thing.

559
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:53,059
Bigger, faster,
stronger, further.

560
01:04:20,788 --> 01:04:21,788
Here it comes.

561
01:05:32,025 --> 01:05:33,526
They look like Mortifiers.

562
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:36,059
Mortifiers.
They ride with Dementus.

563
01:05:36,194 --> 01:05:38,089
Not anymore. They've gone rogue.

564
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,290
Contact.

565
01:05:39,426 --> 01:05:41,125
Contact front!

566
01:05:41,261 --> 01:05:42,426
You, go!

567
01:05:55,444 --> 01:05:57,914
Contact right. Contact left.

568
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,281
Crossbows, War Boys.

569
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:03,249
Load up.

570
01:06:03,385 --> 01:06:04,385
Behind you!

571
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:07,495
Go!

572
01:06:50,363 --> 01:06:52,403
Witness!

573
01:07:14,457 --> 01:07:15,457
That's engine two.

574
01:07:20,265 --> 01:07:22,631
All down on top. Replenish!

575
01:08:04,045 --> 01:08:05,976
We need a short hose and clamps!

576
01:08:06,112 --> 01:08:08,446
Short hose. Clamps.

577
01:08:09,852 --> 01:08:11,647
Short hose. Clamps.

578
01:09:26,222 --> 01:09:27,222
Yes!

579
01:09:39,734 --> 01:09:41,869
Black Thumb? Black Thumb.

580
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:52,820
Up front.

581
01:09:53,649 --> 01:09:55,055
Can I do the Bommyknocker?

582
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:57,018
- What?
- The Bommyknocker.

583
01:09:57,154 --> 01:09:58,154
Not yet.

584
01:10:07,733 --> 01:10:09,429
Eyes left.
They're flanking us.

585
01:10:09,565 --> 01:10:11,365
Eyes right. Eyes right.

586
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:12,500
They're swarming.

587
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:16,343
Black Thumb.

588
01:10:25,686 --> 01:10:27,420
Black Thumb! Are you there?

589
01:10:31,684 --> 01:10:33,151
Now hang tight.

590
01:10:57,844 --> 01:10:59,111
Prae Jack! Prae Jack!

591
01:11:20,301 --> 01:11:24,270
Pissboy. Pissboy!
We got a busted radiator.

592
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,281
Copy P-Jack. On my way.

593
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:33,783
Drink, my rig. Drink this piss.

594
01:11:34,418 --> 01:11:35,418
Come on.

595
01:11:47,397 --> 01:11:48,397
Prae Jack.

596
01:12:14,258 --> 01:12:15,858
Witness!

597
01:12:58,403 --> 01:12:59,539
No!

598
01:14:45,538 --> 01:14:47,344
The Bommyknocker!
Do the Bommyknocker!

599
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,616
- Now?
- Now!

600
01:16:02,322 --> 01:16:03,415
Pull over.

601
01:16:04,892 --> 01:16:07,056
You're going to pull over
and get out.

602
01:16:09,922 --> 01:16:10,928
Stop!

603
01:17:20,267 --> 01:17:21,702
Where did
you think you were going?

604
01:17:28,811 --> 01:17:30,437
If you're running away
from the Citadel,

605
01:17:30,573 --> 01:17:33,443
believe me, the Bullet Farm
is a whole lot worse.

606
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:37,608
The only other place is Gastown.
It's in the hands of Dementus.

607
01:17:37,743 --> 01:17:40,352
A mug who can't even
keep his gangs together.

608
01:17:40,921 --> 01:17:44,087
And that's it.
There is nowhere else.

609
01:17:44,789 --> 01:17:46,059
This is the Wasteland.

610
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,521
Wherever you thought
you were going does not exist.

611
01:17:54,601 --> 01:17:55,901
It's been a hard day.

612
01:17:57,306 --> 01:17:58,563
I lost my convoy.

613
01:17:59,472 --> 01:18:00,741
I lost my crew.

614
01:18:01,973 --> 01:18:03,678
I'm gonna have to start again.

615
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,815
And I'm driving off thinking
I ought to start with you.

616
01:18:12,311 --> 01:18:13,951
You got good vision.

617
01:18:14,087 --> 01:18:15,783
You read the play
and you keep your head.

618
01:18:16,286 --> 01:18:17,819
You may be raw,
but you have about you

619
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:19,617
a purposeful savagery.

620
01:18:21,121 --> 01:18:23,161
You give me time,

621
01:18:23,297 --> 01:18:25,856
I'll teach you everything
you need to know about Road War.

622
01:18:26,826 --> 01:18:29,867
If you survive everything
we take on together,

623
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:31,143
you'll have
all the skills you need

624
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,070
to get wherever you wanna go.

625
01:18:35,675 --> 01:18:37,173
No questions asked.

626
01:18:50,118 --> 01:18:52,056
Keep it. You'll need it.

627
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:26,926
<i>The stars be with you.</i>

628
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:32,558
<i>The stars be with you.</i>

629
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,738
<i>You and me, Little D.</i>

630
01:20:08,098 --> 01:20:11,437
Immortan Joe!

631
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:51,840
Two... four...
six... eight...

632
01:20:51,976 --> 01:20:53,507
Done. Tank's empty.

633
01:20:55,009 --> 01:20:56,761
Everything accounted, down to
the last drop of Mother's Milk.

634
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:59,346
- Good.
- No, it's not good.

635
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:01,051
That piece of anus-pus,
Dementus,

636
01:21:01,186 --> 01:21:02,888
is running Gastown
into the ground

637
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,617
and blaming everyone
but himself.

638
01:21:04,752 --> 01:21:07,393
You tell Immortan Joe
we need a meeting.

639
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:09,129
A war meeting.

640
01:21:09,265 --> 01:21:12,593
Otherwise we're gonna get
our tits caught in the wringer.

641
01:21:13,496 --> 01:21:15,826
Here's the boomstick
you asked for.

642
01:21:24,871 --> 01:21:27,244
Thundersticks.
Bullets all loaded.

643
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,396
For you.

644
01:21:52,541 --> 01:21:53,974
For your travels.

645
01:21:55,335 --> 01:21:56,801
You're done here.

646
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,243
You're free to go.

647
01:22:01,743 --> 01:22:05,953
Food, water, wheels,
whatever you need.

648
01:22:07,515 --> 01:22:09,418
I'll help you put it together.

649
01:22:11,551 --> 01:22:13,158
Give me a couple of days.

650
01:23:14,216 --> 01:23:15,649
We'll lead you in.

651
01:24:02,661 --> 01:24:05,336
Move! Hurry up! Come on!

652
01:24:08,403 --> 01:24:10,209
Back! Get out then!

653
01:24:24,025 --> 01:24:25,890
<i>Stay back!</i>

654
01:24:26,025 --> 01:24:27,985
<i>Back! Stand back.</i>

655
01:24:30,624 --> 01:24:33,496
<i>Citizens of Gastown.</i>

656
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:37,131
<i>I want what you want.
A full belly...</i>

657
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:40,239
and a fistful of bullets
for a tank of gas.

658
01:24:42,174 --> 01:24:44,177
We have to put things right.

659
01:24:46,205 --> 01:24:49,215
And today, we're gonna
do something about it.

660
01:24:54,823 --> 01:24:56,255
Are you in charge here?

661
01:24:59,685 --> 01:25:01,051
You can speak to me.

662
01:25:01,586 --> 01:25:02,586
Yeah.

663
01:25:03,397 --> 01:25:05,462
Well, I've got a message
for Immortan Joe.

664
01:25:07,068 --> 01:25:09,361
We're in a black spiral here.

665
01:25:09,497 --> 01:25:11,767
We can't keep up supply.

666
01:25:11,903 --> 01:25:15,239
Everyone is saying they're being
swindled and short-changed.

667
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:16,655
Everyone is saying
it's my fault.

668
01:25:17,241 --> 01:25:18,706
It's everyone's fault.

669
01:25:20,114 --> 01:25:22,110
I want a meeting
of the warlords.

670
01:25:22,846 --> 01:25:26,649
Me, him, the People Eater,
that idiot Bullet Farmer.

671
01:25:26,784 --> 01:25:29,519
High noon at the Citadel.
Three days from now.

672
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:33,451
Right.

673
01:25:35,989 --> 01:25:37,021
Ah, you better go.

674
01:25:38,565 --> 01:25:40,860
We're not leaving
without our tankers full of gas.

675
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:45,133
Go now.

676
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,614
You wanna get out of here,
follow me.

677
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:03,580
High noon, the Citadel,
three days from now.

678
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:05,483
Be punctual.

679
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:46,290
You give him
a full tank of water,

680
01:27:46,425 --> 01:27:48,821
and 2,000 tits of Mother's Milk

681
01:27:48,957 --> 01:27:51,831
and then you return
empty-handed.

682
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:53,760
Not a drop of guzzolene.

683
01:27:53,896 --> 01:27:55,429
He filched us.
We're being filched.

684
01:27:55,565 --> 01:27:57,262
Let's kill him. Right now.

685
01:27:57,398 --> 01:27:59,731
Shoulda done it long ago, Dad.
Shoulda crushed him, Dad!

686
01:27:59,866 --> 01:28:01,232
Father, give me the War Rig.

687
01:28:01,367 --> 01:28:03,410
Load it up with all
of the firepower you've got,

688
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,743
and I will blow him
from the face of the earth.

689
01:28:05,879 --> 01:28:07,771
How do we do that
before he blows up Gastown?

690
01:28:07,906 --> 01:28:08,973
We'll build it again.

691
01:28:09,108 --> 01:28:10,850
That'd take generations,
you moron.

692
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:12,517
We will build it again.

693
01:28:12,652 --> 01:28:15,111
Your way of thinking
is how he rooks us.

694
01:28:15,247 --> 01:28:16,459
He's got you scared
of his crazy.

695
01:28:16,483 --> 01:28:17,483
Bah!

696
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:19,017
Here's what we do!

697
01:28:19,152 --> 01:28:21,150
We conserve every drop
of guzzolene,

698
01:28:21,286 --> 01:28:23,127
turn off all vehicles,
all generators.

699
01:28:23,263 --> 01:28:24,494
Turn off every water pump

700
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,324
including the Big Four
Aquifer Siphons.

701
01:28:26,460 --> 01:28:27,497
Get.

702
01:28:27,633 --> 01:28:29,462
At first light, leave
for Bullet Farm

703
01:28:29,598 --> 01:28:31,932
with your tankers empty.

704
01:28:32,067 --> 01:28:36,068
Then, return with every munition
you can load.

705
01:28:37,403 --> 01:28:41,138
I want every bullet and firearm,
every caliber and size.

706
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:43,782
Your entire infantry
ready to pick up.

707
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:44,917
Good.

708
01:28:45,652 --> 01:28:47,620
Come to the watchtower.
We'll signal them now.

709
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:50,787
Hell and Hall-elujah!
We're gonna take Gastown.

710
01:28:50,922 --> 01:28:52,855
Hit him! Hit him
when he least suspects it.

711
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:55,758
How do we
stop him blowing up Gastown?

712
01:29:21,688 --> 01:29:25,656
This place at the end
of your map of secrets.

713
01:29:27,588 --> 01:29:28,588
Where is it?

714
01:29:42,242 --> 01:29:43,267
My mother and father...

715
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:46,072
were soldiers.

716
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:49,582
Even as the world fell,

717
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,584
they yearned to be warriors
for a virtuous cause.

718
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:56,951
For them, it never happened.

719
01:30:00,691 --> 01:30:02,429
I wanna help you
find this place.

720
01:30:04,495 --> 01:30:06,092
Wherever it may be.

721
01:30:33,589 --> 01:30:34,593
Come with me.

722
01:31:13,727 --> 01:31:14,727
Ready?

723
01:31:28,044 --> 01:31:29,241
I want your bikes.

724
01:31:29,376 --> 01:31:30,896
Load them on the back
of the V8 Pursuit

725
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,112
and tie them down.

726
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:36,015
Soon as that's done,

727
01:31:36,150 --> 01:31:38,157
load it with food,
fuel and water.

728
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:39,891
As much as you can carry.

729
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:42,529
What's this?
A scouting party?

730
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:44,430
Possibly.

731
01:31:46,961 --> 01:31:48,295
What about us?

732
01:31:48,431 --> 01:31:50,134
You're both
gonna ride on the tanker.

733
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:51,501
What about me?

734
01:31:51,637 --> 01:31:53,639
You're promoted. Rear defense.

735
01:31:54,607 --> 01:31:55,767
- On the War Rig?
- Of course.

736
01:31:57,872 --> 01:31:59,007
What are you doing?

737
01:32:00,776 --> 01:32:02,312
Is there a problem?

738
01:32:02,447 --> 01:32:03,649
You drive the V8.

739
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:05,583
I drive the War Rig.

740
01:32:05,718 --> 01:32:07,983
Not today.
Today you drive Pursuit.

741
01:32:09,181 --> 01:32:10,181
What am I gonna do?

742
01:32:10,217 --> 01:32:10,949
You're with me.

743
01:32:11,084 --> 01:32:12,582
- Up front?
- Up front.

744
01:32:12,717 --> 01:32:14,597
As soon as we load up
the weapons and munitions,

745
01:32:14,725 --> 01:32:16,655
you can drive the rig back.

746
01:32:17,325 --> 01:32:19,532
All the way home?
To the Citadel?

747
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,331
Yep.

748
01:32:21,467 --> 01:32:22,265
Go on.

749
01:32:22,401 --> 01:32:23,401
Whoo!

750
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:38,750
Wanna see what this can do?

751
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:40,917
Hit the second engine.

752
01:33:57,958 --> 01:33:58,958
All dead?

753
01:33:59,433 --> 01:34:00,433
Don't know.

754
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,769
Sniper ambush!

755
01:34:05,805 --> 01:34:07,598
He's got backup. Outside.

756
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:09,269
Between the tanks.

757
01:34:13,172 --> 01:34:14,307
I can't see him.

758
01:34:26,856 --> 01:34:27,856
Behind you.

759
01:36:47,228 --> 01:36:48,494
Do not miss.

760
01:37:17,325 --> 01:37:18,689
Whoo!

761
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,482
Where are they?
Can you see them?

762
01:37:46,257 --> 01:37:47,737
On the ridge,
to the left of the gate.

763
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,606
Give me that.

764
01:38:18,023 --> 01:38:20,025
All right, load me up.
Come on.

765
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:22,220
Come here.

766
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:45,979
Jack!

767
01:40:34,024 --> 01:40:35,655
Yeah? We're good.

768
01:41:10,525 --> 01:41:12,597
We'll head east for three days.

769
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:15,642
Once we clear the escarpment
and the great salt plains,

770
01:41:15,666 --> 01:41:17,895
we'll take the bikes
over the dunes all the way.

771
01:41:19,233 --> 01:41:20,535
All the way.

772
01:41:41,723 --> 01:41:43,692
The digger.
Let's use the digger.

773
01:41:43,828 --> 01:41:44,922
No time.

774
01:41:47,898 --> 01:41:48,898
Out.

775
01:44:16,840 --> 01:44:18,977
Fang it! Fang it!

776
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:25,818
Hello?

777
01:45:26,886 --> 01:45:27,947
Heh?

778
01:45:59,286 --> 01:46:00,819
This one's still alive!

779
01:46:00,954 --> 01:46:01,954
Good.

780
01:46:08,755 --> 01:46:09,890
Get up here.

781
01:46:10,757 --> 01:46:11,991
Come on, get up here.

782
01:46:14,463 --> 01:46:16,730
Did you see that?

783
01:46:16,866 --> 01:46:18,312
You see how they fought
for each other,

784
01:46:18,336 --> 01:46:20,230
this little army of two?

785
01:46:21,673 --> 01:46:24,168
Where were they going,
so full of hope?

786
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,405
There is no hope!

787
01:46:28,374 --> 01:46:31,015
Not for them, not for you!
Certainly not for me!

788
01:46:33,215 --> 01:46:36,422
The day I acquire Bullet Farm,
these two destroy it.

789
01:46:37,854 --> 01:46:39,788
I had Gastown,
I had Bullet Farm.

790
01:46:39,923 --> 01:46:41,502
With that,
I coulda crippled the Citadel.

791
01:46:41,526 --> 01:46:43,429
- Jack.
- Ruled the Wasteland!

792
01:46:43,564 --> 01:46:45,164
- The Wasteland woulda been...
- My Jack.

793
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:45,887
A far better place
for all of us.

794
01:46:46,023 --> 01:46:46,855
Fury.

795
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,401
- Jack.
- No!

796
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:52,730
Get up.

797
01:46:52,866 --> 01:46:54,401
You two.

798
01:46:54,537 --> 01:46:56,975
You two break my heart.

799
01:46:57,111 --> 01:46:58,367
You break my heart.

800
01:46:59,608 --> 01:47:00,743
And that's not fair.

801
01:47:02,206 --> 01:47:05,583
You make me the Dark Dementus.

802
01:47:06,786 --> 01:47:09,920
The Dark Dementus
cannot afford to be soft!

803
01:47:10,723 --> 01:47:13,483
It's the price I pay
to be your leader!

804
01:47:13,619 --> 01:47:16,390
It's the price we all pay
to survive in the Wasteland.

805
01:47:16,525 --> 01:47:18,794
We cannot be soft!

806
01:47:21,367 --> 01:47:23,095
There must be retribution.

807
01:47:25,205 --> 01:47:27,869
Justice and retribution.

808
01:47:43,917 --> 01:47:44,917
Hey, hey, hey!

809
01:47:46,583 --> 01:47:49,419
I want her to watch a while.
String her up.

810
01:47:50,455 --> 01:47:54,163
You're going. You're going.
You're going.

811
01:47:54,298 --> 01:47:55,298
Let's go.

812
01:48:03,034 --> 01:48:04,510
No, mate, other arm.

813
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:09,944
What? You lost your touch?

814
01:48:13,913 --> 01:48:14,916
I'll do it.

815
01:48:38,546 --> 01:48:41,679
Come on, piggy!
Get up. Get up!

816
01:48:57,791 --> 01:48:58,921
Let's go. Go.

817
01:50:01,193 --> 01:50:02,353
Smeg!

818
01:50:09,997 --> 01:50:11,802
Enough! Enough!

819
01:50:13,197 --> 01:50:14,398
I'm bored.

820
01:50:16,201 --> 01:50:18,204
Let's end our cares and go home!

821
01:52:38,046 --> 01:52:39,413
It's all right.

822
01:52:40,416 --> 01:52:43,382
Go back to sleep.
I'll make it nice for you.

823
01:52:45,852 --> 01:52:46,852
Stay!

824
01:52:48,055 --> 01:52:49,894
You'll find peace here.

825
01:52:58,935 --> 01:53:00,465
I'm the Praetorian Furiosa.

826
01:53:02,807 --> 01:53:04,909
I am the Praetorian Furiosa!

827
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:06,911
What happened to you?

828
01:53:07,412 --> 01:53:08,473
Pull.

829
01:53:17,591 --> 01:53:19,147
Any sign of him?

830
01:53:19,282 --> 01:53:20,282
No.

831
01:53:21,093 --> 01:53:22,828
But there's something going on
at Gastown.

832
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:25,187
I think he's blowing up Gastown.

833
01:53:25,323 --> 01:53:26,664
Rubbish.

834
01:53:26,799 --> 01:53:27,965
Take a look.

835
01:53:29,533 --> 01:53:32,728
He fails to turn
up to a meeting and now this.

836
01:53:35,741 --> 01:53:36,998
It's fake.

837
01:53:37,601 --> 01:53:39,301
There's no possible advantage.

838
01:53:39,437 --> 01:53:40,937
We shouldn't have waited.

839
01:53:41,806 --> 01:53:44,516
Why're we waiting now?
Let's go to Gastown now.

840
01:53:44,652 --> 01:53:45,917
He's not at Gastown.

841
01:53:48,955 --> 01:53:50,647
Where's Praetorian Jack?

842
01:53:51,954 --> 01:53:53,187
Where's our War Rig?

843
01:53:53,323 --> 01:53:54,457
He's taken the Bullet Farm.

844
01:53:54,593 --> 01:53:55,593
You're lying.

845
01:53:55,654 --> 01:53:56,694
He's taken the Bullet Farm,

846
01:53:56,795 --> 01:53:58,287
and he's coming here next.

847
01:53:58,422 --> 01:53:59,855
How do you know that?

848
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:02,160
They're coming with
grappling hooks and ladders.

849
01:54:02,296 --> 01:54:03,968
He wants to take the Citadel.

850
01:54:04,103 --> 01:54:05,427
Then we go to the Bullet Farm.

851
01:54:05,562 --> 01:54:07,136
Meet him head-on right now.

852
01:54:07,271 --> 01:54:09,640
It's Gastown that's burning.
He's at Gastown.

853
01:54:09,775 --> 01:54:11,943
He wants to draw you to Gastown.

854
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:14,103
He wants you to leave
the Citadel exposed.

855
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:15,611
So we stay here.

856
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:19,215
We have three choices.
The coward's choice.

857
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:22,046
Stay here and let Dementus
mess with our minds.

858
01:54:22,181 --> 01:54:23,348
The fool's choice,

859
01:54:23,483 --> 01:54:24,887
go out and meet
an invisible enemy

860
01:54:25,022 --> 01:54:26,882
on the road to the Bullet Farm.

861
01:54:27,017 --> 01:54:30,519
Or the warrior's choice,
go to Gastown and crush him.

862
01:54:30,654 --> 01:54:32,259
It is my choice.

863
01:54:32,395 --> 01:54:34,328
We make him think
we're going to Gastown.

864
01:54:37,528 --> 01:54:39,234
If you find him, he's mine.

865
01:55:04,563 --> 01:55:05,898
Yes. Yes!

866
01:55:08,761 --> 01:55:10,562
They're Gastown bound for sure.

867
01:55:16,874 --> 01:55:18,099
So gullible.

868
01:55:18,902 --> 01:55:20,979
I hold them profoundly
in contempt.

869
01:55:31,717 --> 01:55:35,025
Gentlemans, it's time.
Time to do war.

870
01:55:35,161 --> 01:55:37,626
Time to take back
what's rightfully ours.

871
01:55:37,761 --> 01:55:39,188
To the Citadel.

872
01:55:39,323 --> 01:55:41,223
Let's party!

873
01:56:36,189 --> 01:56:38,347
<i>There always was, is,</i>

874
01:56:38,483 --> 01:56:40,520
<i>and will be war.</i>

875
01:56:43,126 --> 01:56:45,030
<i>The Sumerian fought the Elamite.</i>

876
01:56:46,097 --> 01:56:48,165
<i>The Saxon fought the Viking.</i>

877
01:56:49,837 --> 01:56:51,762
<i>And so the histories grew.</i>

878
01:56:52,931 --> 01:56:54,902
<i>There were the Wars
of the Roses,</i>

879
01:56:55,037 --> 01:56:56,206
<i>The Oranges.</i>

880
01:56:56,973 --> 01:56:58,670
<i>The Opium Wars.</i>

881
01:57:00,478 --> 01:57:04,643
<i>The One-Day, Six-Day,
Thousand-Day Wars.</i>

882
01:57:07,881 --> 01:57:11,716
<i>North against South.
East against West.</i>

883
01:57:15,790 --> 01:57:20,395
<i>The first, second,
third countless wars</i>

884
01:57:20,530 --> 01:57:22,595
<i>of religion
and righteous belief.</i>

885
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:30,072
<i>The Oil Wars. Water Wars.</i>

886
01:57:30,207 --> 01:57:32,110
<i>The Tri-Nation Nuclear War.</i>

887
01:57:33,507 --> 01:57:35,839
<i>The Battle of the Boomtowns.</i>

888
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:39,084
<i>And now, my dears...</i>

889
01:57:40,381 --> 01:57:42,879
<i>The Forty-Day Wasteland War.</i>

890
01:58:01,466 --> 01:58:03,603
<i>Eyes for eyes.</i>

891
01:58:04,668 --> 01:58:06,672
<i>Teeth for teeth.</i>

892
01:58:09,476 --> 01:58:12,117
<i>Rage fueled by grief.</i>

893
01:58:36,404 --> 01:58:37,406
I need a vehicle.

894
01:58:38,905 --> 01:58:40,444
There's nothing here,
not even a bike.

895
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:43,071
- Winch me down.
- What're you gonna do? Walk?

896
01:58:47,315 --> 01:58:48,813
I've got a vehicle.

897
01:58:58,625 --> 01:59:00,495
Can't wait for you to see it.

898
01:59:07,335 --> 01:59:08,998
Isn't she wonderful?

899
02:00:22,642 --> 02:00:24,249
Hey! Look at this.

900
02:00:25,678 --> 02:00:27,219
I think this one might fit.

901
02:00:29,155 --> 02:00:31,014
Try it on! Try it on!

902
02:00:34,620 --> 02:00:36,250
Every moment wasted,

903
02:00:36,386 --> 02:00:39,055
that mongrel gets
farther and farther away.

904
02:00:39,658 --> 02:00:40,694
Coming up!

905
02:00:42,367 --> 02:00:43,896
And I want her fuel too.

906
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:47,195
I want all of her fuel,
and her water and her weapon.

907
02:00:48,736 --> 02:00:51,573
A fool can run,
but he can't hide.

908
02:00:54,704 --> 02:00:55,704
It's gonna fit.

909
02:00:56,874 --> 02:00:58,244
Hey, Scrotus.

910
02:00:58,380 --> 02:01:00,084
- Scrotus!
- What?

911
02:01:00,219 --> 02:01:02,384
You'll need some proper tucker.

912
02:01:02,519 --> 02:01:04,253
Canine kebab.

913
02:01:04,388 --> 02:01:05,581
We'll take it with us.

914
02:01:05,717 --> 02:01:06,824
What do you mean, "us?"

915
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,118
I'm coming with you.

916
02:01:08,253 --> 02:01:09,824
No, you're not.
You'll slow me down.

917
02:01:09,960 --> 02:01:11,995
I'm gonna make sure
that dumb Dementus is dead.

918
02:01:12,131 --> 02:01:12,954
No, you're not!

919
02:01:13,089 --> 02:01:14,490
You stay here and eat some dog.

920
02:01:26,804 --> 02:01:28,236
What was that?

921
02:01:28,372 --> 02:01:31,745
That is the darkest of angels.

922
02:01:32,714 --> 02:01:35,177
The fifth Rider
of the Apocalypse.

923
02:02:25,939 --> 02:02:26,939
Who are they?

924
02:02:27,497 --> 02:02:30,305
Someone competent
and excessively resentful.

925
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:31,667
Who do you suppose they want?

926
02:02:31,803 --> 02:02:33,301
Me, without my crew.

927
02:02:34,675 --> 02:02:36,508
We'll wait here. Ambush him.

928
02:02:36,644 --> 02:02:37,745
Let's go back.

929
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:39,307
No, no, no.
We have to split up.

930
02:02:40,109 --> 02:02:42,044
Here, no time for long goodbyes.

931
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:43,656
We've done some
mighty things together.

932
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:44,680
Goodbye.

933
02:04:22,913 --> 02:04:24,049
I'm not Dementus!

934
02:04:27,687 --> 02:04:29,461
We swapped bikes!

935
02:07:07,285 --> 02:07:08,510
You've found me.

936
02:07:11,322 --> 02:07:12,580
Freakish.

937
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:15,154
You are a freak.

938
02:07:18,097 --> 02:07:20,993
You could have necked me
in the night, but you didn't.

939
02:07:21,128 --> 02:07:23,668
So, you must be
that other thing.

940
02:07:24,766 --> 02:07:26,594
Are you that thing?

941
02:09:05,736 --> 02:09:07,266
I have nothing.

942
02:09:08,770 --> 02:09:10,097
I am nothing.

943
02:09:11,937 --> 02:09:12,937
I'm yours.

944
02:09:34,533 --> 02:09:35,657
Remember me?

945
02:09:49,405 --> 02:09:51,981
You fabulous thing.

946
02:09:55,118 --> 02:09:57,783
You crawled
out of a pitiless grave,

947
02:09:57,918 --> 02:09:59,285
deeper than Hell.

948
02:10:00,553 --> 02:10:02,524
And only one thing's
gonna do that for you.

949
02:10:02,660 --> 02:10:04,422
And not hope. Hate.

950
02:10:06,762 --> 02:10:08,491
No shame in hate.

951
02:10:08,627 --> 02:10:10,725
It's one of the great forces
of nature.

952
02:10:15,138 --> 02:10:16,841
That wasn't hope,
that was instinct.

953
02:10:32,082 --> 02:10:33,082
So...

954
02:10:34,627 --> 02:10:36,423
this is the day I die.

955
02:10:37,159 --> 02:10:38,621
I've always wondered how...

956
02:10:42,759 --> 02:10:45,030
Fifteen years ago
there was a woman.

957
02:10:45,165 --> 02:10:46,964
Oh, so there's more to this.

958
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:48,433
Do you remember her?

959
02:10:49,265 --> 02:10:50,600
Do I get a clue?

960
02:10:56,108 --> 02:10:58,482
Right, okay. Um...

961
02:10:58,617 --> 02:11:00,546
Redhead. Even her pu...

962
02:11:03,821 --> 02:11:06,821
Was she your mother? Sister?

963
02:11:06,956 --> 02:11:08,984
Did she beg, did she scream?

964
02:11:09,120 --> 02:11:11,753
The ones who yell the least tend
to stick in my mind.

965
02:11:14,064 --> 02:11:15,368
Despite everything
you did to her,

966
02:11:15,392 --> 02:11:16,862
she was magnificent.

967
02:11:16,998 --> 02:11:17,998
Oh, you were there.

968
02:11:20,804 --> 02:11:23,402
My childhood. My mother.

969
02:11:24,576 --> 02:11:25,734
I want them back.

970
02:11:26,644 --> 02:11:27,644
Of course you do.

971
02:11:27,678 --> 02:11:29,106
I want them back!

972
02:11:29,242 --> 02:11:30,578
That's exactly how I felt.

973
02:11:31,314 --> 02:11:34,013
My own family.
My own magnificent beauties.

974
02:11:34,149 --> 02:11:36,712
Taken so unjustly. Immutably.

975
02:11:36,847 --> 02:11:38,780
I'm right there,
I'm right there with you.

976
02:11:41,257 --> 02:11:43,791
I too craved nothing
but revenge.

977
02:11:43,927 --> 02:11:45,626
A big bellyful of revenge.

978
02:11:47,424 --> 02:11:49,395
If I may...

979
02:11:51,003 --> 02:11:52,470
If the shooter goes
around the back,

980
02:11:52,605 --> 02:11:53,605
the shootee won't know

981
02:11:53,698 --> 02:11:56,039
the precise moment
of the execution.

982
02:11:57,934 --> 02:12:00,302
Minor torture,
but every little bit counts.

983
02:12:00,438 --> 02:12:01,572
Either way, that rat shot

984
02:12:01,708 --> 02:12:03,772
will turn my brain
into a pink mist so fast,

985
02:12:03,907 --> 02:12:05,642
I won't even hear
the sound of the gun.

986
02:12:06,585 --> 02:12:08,046
I'll hear it.

987
02:12:08,549 --> 02:12:09,897
I'll hear it for the rest
of my days.

988
02:12:09,921 --> 02:12:10,953
Of course you will.

989
02:12:11,089 --> 02:12:12,719
I'll feel the kickback
in my hand.

990
02:12:12,854 --> 02:12:13,854
Sure.

991
02:12:15,551 --> 02:12:17,759
I'll remember your face.

992
02:12:17,895 --> 02:12:19,896
As the slug worms its way

993
02:12:20,032 --> 02:12:21,625
into the soft matter
of your brain,

994
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,759
taking with it what you call
your reason.

995
02:12:24,701 --> 02:12:25,937
And your memory,

996
02:12:27,272 --> 02:12:29,637
from which my mother
will fortunately be absent.

997
02:12:29,772 --> 02:12:30,772
Brilliant.

998
02:12:31,341 --> 02:12:33,373
I'll be dead and you'll
still be sorrowing

999
02:12:33,508 --> 02:12:35,980
your lovey-dovey and
your mommy magnificent.

1000
02:12:36,548 --> 02:12:37,874
You idiot.

1001
02:12:38,009 --> 02:12:40,215
You can never balance
the scales of their suffering.

1002
02:12:43,746 --> 02:12:46,815
- Give them back.
- I can't!

1003
02:12:48,127 --> 02:12:50,417
What you want, dear,
are my cries of anguish.

1004
02:12:50,553 --> 02:12:52,160
Anguish without end.

1005
02:12:52,296 --> 02:12:54,460
And if I could give you that,
I would.

1006
02:12:54,595 --> 02:12:56,764
But I don't fear
the loss of bliss in Heaven.

1007
02:12:56,900 --> 02:12:59,168
Or retribution in Hell.

1008
02:12:59,303 --> 02:13:01,169
And I've got a fiendishly high
pain threshold.

1009
02:13:01,305 --> 02:13:03,231
Again, do it again.

1010
02:13:09,245 --> 02:13:11,912
If you can't do me quick,

1011
02:13:12,048 --> 02:13:13,316
you'll have to do me slow.

1012
02:13:15,113 --> 02:13:18,851
But you are never going to get
anything close to what you want.

1013
02:14:15,713 --> 02:14:17,312
Little D?

1014
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:26,321
I have been waiting for you.

1015
02:14:26,456 --> 02:14:29,154
I've been waiting
for someone like you,

1016
02:14:29,289 --> 02:14:32,087
someone worthy of me.

1017
02:14:33,023 --> 02:14:36,926
No honor, no rule of law
to sort things out.

1018
02:14:37,061 --> 02:14:40,269
Just two evil bastards
out here in the Wasteland.

1019
02:14:41,735 --> 02:14:45,173
You do this, you do this right,
you become me.

1020
02:14:45,309 --> 02:14:47,841
- I am nothing like you.
- You are me.

1021
02:14:47,977 --> 02:14:49,738
Already dead.

1022
02:14:49,874 --> 02:14:51,875
To feel alive,
we seek sensation.

1023
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:55,483
Any sensation to wash away
the cranky black sorrow.

1024
02:14:56,653 --> 02:14:59,252
And it leaves us for a moment,
but then it comes back,

1025
02:14:59,387 --> 02:15:00,690
and we have to do it all again.

1026
02:15:00,825 --> 02:15:02,249
And we need more,

1027
02:15:02,385 --> 02:15:04,962
and each time we need more
until too much is never enough.

1028
02:15:05,097 --> 02:15:08,561
We are the already dead,
Little D.

1029
02:15:12,528 --> 02:15:13,764
You and me.

1030
02:15:23,749 --> 02:15:25,072
The question is...

1031
02:15:28,154 --> 02:15:30,913
do you have it in you
to make it epic?

1032
02:15:51,101 --> 02:15:52,375
<i>She took away his voice,</i>

1033
02:15:52,511 --> 02:15:55,806
<i>and they spent the rest
of the day in silence.</i>

1034
02:15:58,281 --> 02:15:59,711
<i>There are those who prefer</i>

1035
02:15:59,846 --> 02:16:02,010
<i>that she did
more than shoot him.</i>

1036
02:16:05,449 --> 02:16:10,161
<i>They claim that she ended him
in ways more fitting.</i>

1037
02:16:13,630 --> 02:16:15,623
<i>They tell
of righteous perversities</i>

1038
02:16:15,758 --> 02:16:18,059
<i>and witty mutilations.</i>

1039
02:16:21,630 --> 02:16:26,804
<i>But this is the truth whispered
to me by Furiosa herself.</i>

1040
02:16:28,772 --> 02:16:30,841
<i>Deep in the Citadel,</i>

1041
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:34,185
<i>high up
in the hydroponic gardens,</i>

1042
02:16:35,354 --> 02:16:38,315
<i>there is a tree
unlike any other.</i>

1043
02:16:42,659 --> 02:16:46,857
<i>Its soil is human.
Its nutrients human.</i>

1044
02:16:48,093 --> 02:16:51,158
<i>Maggots debriding
his necrotic flesh.</i>

1045
02:16:52,768 --> 02:16:56,537
<i>It was an echo
growing out of a living being.</i>

1046
02:17:03,976 --> 02:17:06,016
<i>This is our first fruit,</i>

1047
02:17:06,151 --> 02:17:07,945
<i>but it's not for you and me.</i>

1048
02:17:09,315 --> 02:17:12,823
<i>Each of us in our own way
will vanish from this Earth.</i>

1049
02:17:12,959 --> 02:17:14,357
<i>And then perhaps...</i>

1050
02:17:15,726 --> 02:17:18,757
<i>some uncorrupted life
will rise to adorn it.</i>
