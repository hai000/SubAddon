1
00:00:28,477 --> 00:00:30,474
<i>Flight 291 is now boarding.</i>

2
00:00:30,475 --> 00:00:33,442
<i>All passengers
please proceed to Gate 1.</i>

3
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:56,034
Please state your name.

4
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:57,532
Rebecca Smallbone, sir.

5
00:00:57,533 --> 00:01:00,001
- Your name?
- Daniel Smallbone.

6
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:03,577
Ben. Benjamin.

7
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:05,073
Uh, Joel.

8
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:06,480
Luke.

9
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:09,615
Joshua.

10
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,653
So just the six kids then, huh?

11
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:23,926
So tell me, uh,
what are you doing in America?

12
00:01:26,634 --> 00:01:28,931
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you
to look forward, please.

13
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:32,374
Tell me, what's your name?

14
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,742
Ma'am, your name.

15
00:01:46,983 --> 00:01:49,419
G'day and good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

16
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:52,324
Welcome aboard
Qantas Flight 199,

17
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:55,295
with service from Sydney
to Los Angeles.

18
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:59,032
Flight time will be 14 hours
and 32 minutes.

19
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,070
We ask that you remain seated

20
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:02,598
until the captain turns off
the seatbelt sign,

21
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,769
at which time it will
be safe to...

22
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:45,872
Everybody get ready to rock

23
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:49,041
'cause all the way
from the U.S.A...

24
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:54,723
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, Stryper!

25
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:07,366
So good, Joshie.

26
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:11,567
To hell with the devil!

27
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,224
- Art!
- David.

28
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,894
- Hey.
- You did it again.

29
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:33,988
I told 'em back home,

30
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,963
"You wanna conquer
the outback, I got your guy."

31
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:36,925
- Oh, look.
- Amazing.

32
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,032
Every promoter dreams
of bands like this.

33
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:40,332
So, it makes my job easy.

34
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,900
Hey,
have you met my better half?

35
00:03:41,901 --> 00:03:43,166
Hi. Helen.

36
00:03:43,167 --> 00:03:45,599
Wow. Helen.

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,666
Oh.

38
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,435
Your much better half.

39
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,005
David, listen.

40
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:53,413
I've been talking with
Eddie DeGarmo and Dana Key,

41
00:03:53,414 --> 00:03:55,576
- planning an Australian tour.
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

42
00:03:55,577 --> 00:03:56,646
With all due respect,

43
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,813
that's a bit of a step back.
Right?

44
00:03:58,814 --> 00:04:01,883
I mean, hey,
look at the audience.

45
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,593
The Australian crowd,
they've delivered,

46
00:04:03,594 --> 00:04:04,754
I've delivered.

47
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:06,959
We're ready for more.
We're ready for Amy.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,889
Now, look, man,

49
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,755
that's way more
than a step forward.

50
00:04:09,756 --> 00:04:11,131
- Ah.
- Getting her band,

51
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:12,198
bringing production down here.

52
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,663
Yeah, we'd make back every cent.

53
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,299
Look,
she's at the top of her game.

54
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,498
I'm at the top of mine.

55
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:18,001
One plus one equals three.

56
00:04:18,568 --> 00:04:19,636
All right, look.

57
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:21,540
I'll talk to her team.
We'll catch up.

58
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,069
All right.
Just give a listen.

59
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,140
- Think about it.
- Thanks very much.

60
00:04:27,076 --> 00:04:29,413
Might be...
another late one.

61
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:31,478
Kiss the kids goodnight for me.

62
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:32,650
Good night.

63
00:04:57,507 --> 00:04:58,811
You okay?

64
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:10,757
You should go to sleep now, okay?

65
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:15,227
<i>Can Dad come tuck me in?</i>

66
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:16,862
Oh, he's at work, honey.

67
00:05:17,662 --> 00:05:19,667
Why is he working all the time?

68
00:05:20,668 --> 00:05:24,735
Well, takes a lot
to live out your dream.

69
00:05:24,736 --> 00:05:29,105
You know, a lot of hard work
and sacrifice.

70
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:41,117
Do you have a dream, Mum?

71
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:50,566
My dream has always been
to have a great, big family.

72
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:54,636
So you've already got
your dream, then.

73
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,676
Night, Lukey.

74
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:07,781
So, this is it, huh?

75
00:06:08,645 --> 00:06:09,813
It's a done deal?

76
00:06:09,814 --> 00:06:11,647
I've gotta crosscheck
a couple of deal points,

77
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:14,113
but it's as good as done, yeah.

78
00:06:14,114 --> 00:06:17,788
Well, I am proud of you,
however it goes.

79
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,553
Oh, there's only one way
it can go, darling.

80
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:21,327
It's Amy Grant.

81
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:23,126
I always loved your optimism.

82
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:28,130
It's just a lot of money.

83
00:06:28,131 --> 00:06:30,936
And I feel like we're putting
our lives on the line.

84
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:33,675
You don't think I'm up for it?

85
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:36,770
No. I... You know I do.

86
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,339
I'm just not sure I am.

87
00:06:40,476 --> 00:06:45,749
It's not just the finances.
The kids miss you. I miss you.

88
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,054
I know.
Look, it's a two-week tour.

89
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,689
I'll take one of the boys.

90
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,190
And then they'll all
settle down.

91
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:56,797
We'll go on holidays.

92
00:06:57,728 --> 00:06:58,931
What do you reckon?

93
00:07:04,837 --> 00:07:07,234
Nothing in this business
is ever 100%.

94
00:07:07,235 --> 00:07:10,041
But this is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, darl.

95
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,043
She'll be all right.

96
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,287
<i>And the first thing to say is</i>

97
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,554
<i>that the accounts do show</i>

98
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:23,449
<i>that Australia's in a recession.</i>

99
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,452
<i>This is a recession
that Australia had to have.</i>

100
00:07:26,453 --> 00:07:28,491
<i>And that was
our Deputy Prime Minister,</i>

101
00:07:28,492 --> 00:07:29,560
<i>Paul Keating.</i>

102
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,061
<i>In other news, American artist,</i>

103
00:07:31,062 --> 00:07:33,728
<i>Amy Grant finishes off
her coast-to-coast tour tonight</i>

104
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:34,798
<i>at the Opera House.</i>

105
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,535
<i>And now here's
her number one hit,</i>

106
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:37,601
Lead Me On.

107
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:39,400
<i>You're listening to Triple FM.</i>

108
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,741
They're thrilled
to have you here.

109
00:07:43,742 --> 00:07:45,483
It's gonna be a great show,
David.

110
00:07:47,315 --> 00:07:48,882
I'm so sorry, Amy.

111
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:51,085
Hey.

112
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:26,645
Ladies and gentlemen,

113
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:29,554
looks like we're headed through
a little bit of a rough patch.

114
00:08:29,555 --> 00:08:31,823
So let's buckle those seatbelts.

115
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:33,921
If you look out the left side
of the aircraft,

116
00:08:33,922 --> 00:08:36,662
you'll see a glorious sunrise.

117
00:08:36,663 --> 00:08:39,031
We're four hours
from the United States.

118
00:08:45,676 --> 00:08:47,670
<i>I had the billboards,
the radio ads,</i>

119
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:48,773
<i>TV spots, flyers...</i>

120
00:08:48,774 --> 00:08:50,040
<i>And I had two other promoters</i>

121
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,677
<i>begging for your job,
but I gave it to you.</i>

122
00:08:51,678 --> 00:08:52,741
And then the economy crashed...

123
00:08:52,742 --> 00:08:53,844
<i>Look, it doesn't matter.</i>

124
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:55,178
<i>It's your job
to put butts in seats.</i>

125
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:56,514
- There's more to...
<i>- It's your job to do the math</i>

126
00:08:56,515 --> 00:08:57,978
<i>like you said you could.</i>

127
00:08:57,979 --> 00:08:59,850
I did everything I know to do.

128
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,054
And look,
tell Amy that again, I'm...

129
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:04,351
<i>Amy doesn't know about this
and she doesn't need to.</i>

130
00:09:04,352 --> 00:09:06,358
<i>Because she'd give you
the shirt off her back,</i>

131
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,354
<i>if I'd let her.</i>

132
00:09:07,355 --> 00:09:10,291
<i>But I can't.
I have to look out for her.</i>

133
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,900
<i>I got a crew to pay
and promises to keep.</i>

134
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:18,504
Art. I'm gonna lose everything.

135
00:09:18,505 --> 00:09:20,871
<i>Man, I wish I could help you.</i>

136
00:09:20,872 --> 00:09:22,778
<i>You signed the contract,
brother.</i>

137
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:48,870
Kids?

138
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:53,974
- Helen?
- We're in the backyard!

139
00:10:01,983 --> 00:10:04,915
Surprise!

140
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:10,584
Hip-hip!
Hurray!

141
00:10:32,974 --> 00:10:34,916
Happy birthday, darling.

142
00:10:36,213 --> 00:10:37,916
- How ya going, old bloke?
- Dad.

143
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,480
Hi. Hey.
Happy birthday, my boy.

144
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,349
Oh, I think we got him, hey,
Grandpa James?

145
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,989
- I think so.
- Are you surprised, Dad?

146
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,591
- Are you?
- I couldn't be more surprised.

147
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,368
Let's party!
Yeah!

148
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:55,934
<i>That rhythmical beat,</i>

149
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:58,676
<i>so strong
in the Australian nation.</i>

150
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,246
<i>You wanna clap your hands
or anything,</i>

151
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,276
<i>don't feel shy or embarrassed.</i>

152
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:07,473
All the Roosters have signed it.

153
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:10,343
Oh, wow. Blow me down.

154
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,982
Right, thank you, boys.
Thanks, darling.

155
00:11:12,983 --> 00:11:15,583
I...

156
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,625
I will begin by thanking
Hel herself...

157
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:24,962
I meant to say Helen,
for this very grand party,

158
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:28,064
and for the way
she's loved my son.

159
00:11:28,065 --> 00:11:31,768
And for giving me,
not one, not three,

160
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,210
but six grandchildren.

161
00:11:35,642 --> 00:11:37,407
You're the family glue, Hel.

162
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,143
And now on
to the man of the hour.

163
00:11:41,144 --> 00:11:43,546
My old man of a son,

164
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:44,579
David Tom.

165
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,920
You've always been a renegade,
David.

166
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:51,186
Dreamed big, sometimes too big
for my comfort,

167
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:54,361
and, uh, for Helen's too,
I'm sure.

168
00:11:55,224 --> 00:11:57,229
But you've always
found your footing.

169
00:11:58,302 --> 00:11:59,396
You've provided.

170
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:03,103
You've achieved so much.

171
00:12:05,135 --> 00:12:06,601
But look around you, David.

172
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:10,572
Your wife, your family...

173
00:12:11,974 --> 00:12:13,179
Your faith.

174
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:19,581
Now, son, that's what
makes you rich in life.

175
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,025
Yours is the earth
and everything that's in it.

176
00:12:26,923 --> 00:12:28,156
To David.

177
00:12:28,157 --> 00:12:29,893
To David.
To Dad.

178
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,769
Okay, okay. One more prezzie.

179
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,332
Thank you, darl.

180
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:40,803
Surprise, my love.

181
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,674
Aw.

182
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:11,237
<i>What is it
you're not telling me?</i>

183
00:13:15,908 --> 00:13:18,505
I'm worried about you

184
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:22,009
and what the doctor said
when you had Josh.

185
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:24,118
Oh, darl, I'm not.

186
00:13:25,817 --> 00:13:26,824
Don't worry.

187
00:13:30,057 --> 00:13:31,956
That's not it, is it?
What's wrong?

188
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:34,161
It's all right.
I'll sort it out.

189
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Okay.

190
00:13:36,996 --> 00:13:38,731
What is it you're sorting out?

191
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:41,432
- Helen, I...
- David.

192
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,409
It's the Amy tour.

193
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,446
I'm gonna lose
half a million dollars.

194
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:02,051
Helen. I'm sorry.

195
00:14:02,052 --> 00:14:04,791
No one anticipated this economy.

196
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:11,528
We're gonna lose everything.

197
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:53,071
<i>Hello?</i>
Eddie DeGarmo.

198
00:14:53,072 --> 00:14:55,536
Uh, David Smallbone
in Australia.

199
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:57,713
<i>The David Smallbone
from Australia</i>

200
00:14:57,714 --> 00:14:59,874
<i>is the only David Smallbone
I know.</i>

201
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,280
Right.

202
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:05,279
Hey, you still looking to come
down here, uh, to tour?

203
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,484
<i>We're not hoping, we're coming.</i>

204
00:15:07,485 --> 00:15:10,618
- You still need a promoter?
<i>- We got it figured out.</i>

205
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,721
<i>Found someone
who actually believes in us.</i>

206
00:15:14,223 --> 00:15:15,694
I believe in you.

207
00:15:15,695 --> 00:15:16,657
<i>Couple months ago,</i>

208
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:19,325
<i>shoe was on the other foot,
wasn't it?</i>

209
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:20,662
<i>I gotta get back to bed.</i>

210
00:15:20,663 --> 00:15:23,098
<i>By the way, do you know
what time it is over here?</i>

211
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,048
<i>Robert, g'day.</i>

212
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,284
David Smallbone here.
How are ya?

213
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,050
Yeah, just checking in to see
if you need a hand...

214
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:42,085
Dave. How are you, young Sheila?

215
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:44,225
Right. Right, give me a ring.

216
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,060
<i>Need any assistance?</i>

217
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:49,190
Look, I'm free to do
whatever you'd like.

218
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,358
<i>Rosie. David, here.</i>

219
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:53,326
Yeah, it's been donkey's ages.

220
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,232
Hey, Chris, how ya going?

221
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:57,630
Liam, howdy.
You know any openings?

222
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:59,672
I'll, uh, I'll be glad
to help out...

223
00:15:59,673 --> 00:16:01,207
Well, I'm around.

224
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,048
Yeah, we're doing all right.
Thanks for asking.

225
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,166
<i>David.
How's life down under?</i>

226
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:30,671
Oh, I was, uh,
hoping you'd come find out.

227
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:31,799
<i>You know, I'd love to.</i>

228
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,938
<i>We're running fast
and pushing hard over here.</i>

229
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,537
Oh, that's commendable.

230
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:37,971
Unless you're running
in circles, obviously.

231
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,583
Are you?

232
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:54,290
Darling, it's Carman.
He's a major artist.

233
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:56,456
And, it's Nashville.

234
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:58,695
It's where the industry is.

235
00:17:00,898 --> 00:17:03,964
- It's where one industry is.
- It's the only one I know.

236
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:07,269
Yeah, and we have to move
halfway around the world for it.

237
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,302
You married me for adventure.

238
00:17:09,303 --> 00:17:10,938
Yeah, when I was 20.

239
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,539
Is there really no other way?

240
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,979
I could go ahead
for a few months

241
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,048
and get everything set...

242
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,343
No, we don't
break up the family.

243
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:18,649
We stay together.

244
00:17:20,953 --> 00:17:22,392
Darling, I'm done in.

245
00:17:23,452 --> 00:17:24,718
There's nothing
left for us here.

246
00:17:24,719 --> 00:17:27,487
Oh, Bec just got lead vocals
in school band.

247
00:17:27,488 --> 00:17:28,688
Daniel's made the swim team.

248
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:30,063
Joshie's about to go
into year one.

249
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:31,728
What, we just pluck 'em
out of school?

250
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:35,229
We couldn't afford to keep 'em
in school,

251
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,630
even if we stayed.

252
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:38,533
Yeah, but I'm saying
they have lives.

253
00:17:38,534 --> 00:17:41,841
We have lives.
And friends and family.

254
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:43,344
And also, I'm preggers.

255
00:17:44,543 --> 00:17:45,805
So how can we say goodbye
to everything

256
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,675
that we know and love
without being sure

257
00:17:48,676 --> 00:17:50,578
that there's absolutely
no other way?

258
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:53,647
Helen, you know
I'd do any job for you.

259
00:17:53,648 --> 00:17:55,291
But the economy's wrecked.

260
00:17:55,292 --> 00:17:56,883
I'm 40.

261
00:17:56,884 --> 00:18:00,388
Music is all I know.
It's what I was made to do.

262
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:01,590
I can't sing, I can't play,

263
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,800
but I can connect an artist
to an audience.

264
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,529
I can connect people
to something

265
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,403
higher and greater
than the here and now.

266
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:14,469
I don't want the kids
to see me settle,

267
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,036
'cause I don't want them
to settle.

268
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,776
I wanna do something
that matters.

269
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,042
And this is it.

270
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,979
This is my last chance.

271
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:35,888
Two years. We can do two years.

272
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,992
That's enough time for you
to have a real go.

273
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:42,029
And it also gives us an out
if things aren't working.

274
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:43,969
Two years.

275
00:18:54,577 --> 00:18:56,351
Just read it when you get there.

276
00:18:57,579 --> 00:18:59,681
Love you.

277
00:18:59,682 --> 00:19:01,851
Keep telling myself,
it's just two years.

278
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:05,057
Your visa says six months.

279
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:06,188
Yeah, well, we'll have to renew.

280
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,524
Oh, surely by then,

281
00:19:07,525 --> 00:19:09,364
you'll all have come
to your senses, love.

282
00:19:12,033 --> 00:19:14,501
Applied for all the kids,
did you?

283
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,862
Mum.

284
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,901
Can't wait to see you again.

285
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,811
Sad to see you go,
but it'll be good for you.

286
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,349
All of you.
Great things in store.

287
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,851
Don't let him miss it,
all right?

288
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:45,598
"If you can dream..."

289
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,832
"And not make dreams
your master..."

290
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:51,967
"You'll be a man, my son."

291
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:58,171
- I'll keep him in check.
- I know you will.

292
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,013
Go give America
all the hell they can handle.

293
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:06,655
Okay.

294
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:12,124
Ladies and gentlemen,

295
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:13,389
it's our pleasure to welcome you

296
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,930
to Los Angeles, California,

297
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:17,959
also known
as The City of Angels.

298
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,598
For your safety and the safety
of those around you,

299
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:23,031
please remain seated
with your seatbelt fastened,

300
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:26,001
and keep the aisles clear
until we're parked at the gate.

301
00:20:36,514 --> 00:20:38,915
Okay, stay close. Let's go.

302
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:48,393
How many?

303
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:51,159
Uh, eight of us.
Two adults and six kids.

304
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,192
Catholic?

305
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:57,232
What brings you and six kids
to the United States,

306
00:20:57,233 --> 00:21:00,440
Mr. Smallbone?

307
00:21:00,441 --> 00:21:01,635
Well, if I was gonna come up
with a fake name,

308
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,170
it wouldn't be that one, right?

309
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:05,945
Yeah.

310
00:21:07,244 --> 00:21:08,575
Uh...

311
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:09,877
In the music industry.

312
00:21:09,878 --> 00:21:12,179
Here to start a record label
with an artist.

313
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:14,385
How long you intend to stay?

314
00:21:14,386 --> 00:21:16,451
- Six months and...
- Two years.

315
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:18,355
You told us two years.

316
00:21:18,356 --> 00:21:19,923
These here are six-month visas.

317
00:21:19,924 --> 00:21:24,595
Right. If needed, we'd apply
for an extension, of course.

318
00:21:24,596 --> 00:21:26,296
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step aside.

319
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:27,601
I'll be right with you.

320
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,533
Door to the side, please.

321
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:31,935
Let's go, kids.
Let's go this way.

322
00:21:38,407 --> 00:21:41,582
So tell me, uh,
what are you doing in America?

323
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:44,843
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to look forward.

324
00:21:44,844 --> 00:21:46,185
We're gonna miss our flight.

325
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:47,714
If they don't send us back home.

326
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,051
What's your name?

327
00:21:50,322 --> 00:21:53,291
Ma'am, your name.

328
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:56,025
Oh, sorry. Helen Smallbone.

329
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,832
Oh. That's from my mum.

330
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:05,736
Ma'am, you're gonna
need to stand back.

331
00:22:05,737 --> 00:22:08,007
I'm not gonna ask you again.

332
00:22:09,207 --> 00:22:11,178
Joshie.

333
00:22:21,751 --> 00:22:23,184
The baby's onesie.

334
00:22:30,861 --> 00:22:33,264
Joshie, no.

335
00:22:35,238 --> 00:22:36,732
Stop crying, all right?
Please stop crying.

336
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,171
Ma'am, keep him quiet

337
00:22:38,172 --> 00:22:39,372
or we'll need to separate you.

338
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:43,273
Shut those tears off right away.

339
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:44,341
Okay? Shut 'em off.

340
00:22:44,342 --> 00:22:46,277
You be a big boy now.

341
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:48,313
Josh. Stop it!

342
00:23:41,437 --> 00:23:42,530
You're free to go.

343
00:23:44,603 --> 00:23:45,904
You can thank your mom.

344
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,242
Fine, let's go.
Kids, get your things.

345
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:52,647
We gotta go.

346
00:23:57,384 --> 00:23:58,851
Welcome to America.

347
00:24:08,792 --> 00:24:10,390
Hey, I think this is us, guys.

348
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,964
Hi, there.
How're you all doing today?

349
00:24:16,965 --> 00:24:18,802
Oh, we're in a terrible state.

350
00:24:18,803 --> 00:24:20,735
We got stuck in Customs,
and coppers kept us

351
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,834
in secondary for donkey's ages,

352
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,103
the kids are knackered.

353
00:24:23,104 --> 00:24:24,877
Can we still get to Nashville
this arvo?

354
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:27,340
I, I'm sorry. What?

355
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,011
Uh, what he meant to say
is that we're all pretty weary

356
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,750
and we got pulled aside
by Customs agents

357
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:34,748
and I think we've missed
our flight to Nashville.

358
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:35,885
Could you maybe check

359
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:37,125
if there's another flight
this afternoon?

360
00:24:37,126 --> 00:24:38,383
Of course, ma'am.

361
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:40,695
Why didn't he just say so?

362
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:46,192
Uh, nothing with eight seats
for another three days.

363
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,964
- Oh, fair dinkum!
- Sonny,

364
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:50,096
I'm gonna have to ask you
to watch your language.

365
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,535
We so appreciate you checking.

366
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:52,971
Do you have any other ideas?

367
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:34,440
<i>Attention, please.</i>

368
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:36,441
<i>The train is approaching
Kansas City Union Station.</i>

369
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:44,951
<i>This is Carman.
Leave a message</i>

370
00:25:44,952 --> 00:25:46,018
<i>after the beep.</i>

371
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:47,491
Hey, sorry to keep missing you.

372
00:25:47,492 --> 00:25:48,855
We've had a few delays.

373
00:25:48,856 --> 00:25:51,093
Just a couple days out.

374
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:53,229
I'm really looking forward
to getting started.

375
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:00,428
Yeah, this is us on the right.

376
00:27:10,743 --> 00:27:12,275
Thanks very much for the ride.

377
00:27:13,408 --> 00:27:16,444
- How much do we owe you?
- $14.

378
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,511
Where's all the furniture?

379
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:52,913
I'll try to call Carman again.

380
00:27:52,914 --> 00:27:55,186
Where are we gonna sleep?

381
00:28:05,963 --> 00:28:08,898
Mum? What're we gonna do?

382
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:17,109
Okay, hop in, Lukey.

383
00:28:23,281 --> 00:28:26,580
Hey, Mum, when do we get
to sleep in real beds?

384
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:33,592
Well, you got
the rest of your lives

385
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:35,221
to sleep in real beds, you know?

386
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:39,127
But it's just so boring.

387
00:28:39,128 --> 00:28:40,865
Sometimes when I sleep
in a real bed

388
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:43,003
and I've got nothing to do,
I just...

389
00:28:49,512 --> 00:28:54,843
Think about it.
Cowboys. Astronauts.

390
00:28:54,844 --> 00:28:57,017
Knights in shining armor.

391
00:28:57,817 --> 00:29:00,950
They don't need real beds. No.

392
00:29:00,951 --> 00:29:04,486
Because they have
adventure beds.

393
00:29:04,487 --> 00:29:09,090
Beds that say, "I don't know
what tomorrow's gonna bring,

394
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:12,065
"because my life
is an adventure."

395
00:29:13,227 --> 00:29:14,661
And that's what this is.

396
00:29:16,197 --> 00:29:18,203
Our exciting adventure.

397
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:20,777
Together.

398
00:29:33,516 --> 00:29:36,254
I meet with Carman first thing
in the morning.

399
00:29:38,187 --> 00:29:40,060
Almost out of the woods, darl.

400
00:29:42,057 --> 00:29:43,360
I'll sort it out.

401
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:09,254
G'day. I'm here for Carman
at nine o'clock.

402
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:16,723
- David, you made it!
- Oh, that's one way to put it.

403
00:30:18,696 --> 00:30:20,199
Ah!

404
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,497
- How's Helen? And the kids?
- Oh, she's... They're tired.

405
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:25,699
We got in around midnight
last night, but look,

406
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,303
I hate to cut to the chase
but if we can get squared away

407
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,906
on the contract and the bonus
and a car.

408
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:32,805
We really need a car.

409
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,015
You remember Pierce, right?

410
00:30:37,016 --> 00:30:39,812
Go ahead and take a seat, David.

411
00:30:42,988 --> 00:30:44,723
Day five of the epic test match,

412
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:46,089
Smallbones versus Smallbones,

413
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:48,089
with Smallbones
on the cusp of victory.

414
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,223
You bet we are.

415
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:51,123
Let's go,
World Cup for Australia!

416
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,966
Dad, this place is awesome!

417
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:56,499
We can play cricket
in the house!

418
00:30:57,499 --> 00:30:59,205
You're back already?
That was quick.

419
00:31:09,815 --> 00:31:10,843
What happened?

420
00:31:14,721 --> 00:31:18,023
He, uh, took a better deal.

421
00:31:18,024 --> 00:31:19,956
His label got wind
of what we were doing

422
00:31:19,957 --> 00:31:22,723
and they extended his contract.

423
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:28,399
Helen, I'll...

424
00:31:30,736 --> 00:31:32,168
Groceries.

425
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:35,538
Take Daniel and Bec.
It's a long walk.

426
00:33:37,593 --> 00:33:39,662
That's what got us
through Customs.

427
00:33:43,298 --> 00:33:44,700
It's a miracle.

428
00:33:47,706 --> 00:33:50,772
It's like some kind of sign
that we're supposed to be here.

429
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,913
I agreed to two years.

430
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:03,218
And come what may,

431
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:05,858
I am not gonna be another person

432
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:07,558
that breaks a promise to you.

433
00:34:32,451 --> 00:34:34,786
I know some of you are excited
to be here,

434
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:35,749
and others less so.

435
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:38,157
I for one, am absolutely
thrilled to be here.

436
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:40,122
- Oh, nice one, Joelsy.
- No worries, Bec.

437
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:41,226
Thank you, Joel.

438
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:43,356
However you guys feel
about being here,

439
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:45,827
we completely understand.

440
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:51,569
But the fact is, we are here,
and we need to make it work.

441
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:55,171
And we need to make
some changes.

442
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:57,608
Starting with me and your dad.

443
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:01,040
We need to be honest with you,
because we need your help.

444
00:35:08,082 --> 00:35:13,222
On my last tour back home,
I lost a lot of money.

445
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:15,359
Want us to help you find it?

446
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,295
It's gone now, darling.
Thank you, though.

447
00:35:17,296 --> 00:35:19,329
And because of that,

448
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,491
no one would hire me
in Australia,

449
00:35:20,492 --> 00:35:22,864
so I got a job here.

450
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:27,605
And this morning...

451
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:31,510
that job fell through.

452
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,881
Wait. So we're not going back?

453
00:35:35,882 --> 00:35:37,447
Your dad and I believe

454
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:39,044
that this is where
we're supposed to be.

455
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:42,683
- So this isn't an adventure?
- Oh, no, it is.

456
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,888
Every adventure has perils
and pitfalls.

457
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,083
And pirates.

458
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:48,626
Yeah, we've had a fair few
of those, haven't we?

459
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:53,057
So we have to be brave together.

460
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:55,696
And it's not enough for us
to just be here for Dad.

461
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:57,899
We have to be here
for each other as well.

462
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:03,377
And we need to pray, every day,

463
00:36:04,243 --> 00:36:05,907
for everything that we need.

464
00:36:12,152 --> 00:36:14,278
This is everything we have.

465
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:18,524
And sometimes it's gonna grow,
and sometimes it will shrink.

466
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,722
Rent, bills, groceries.

467
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:25,058
But it cannot be allowed
to disappear.

468
00:36:29,466 --> 00:36:31,834
Can we pray now? I'll start.

469
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:38,977
God, I pray
that you will give us

470
00:36:38,978 --> 00:36:40,480
everything that we need.

471
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,746
A job for Dad.

472
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:46,445
If it'll help, I wouldn't mind
having one, too.

473
00:36:46,446 --> 00:36:48,681
- Same.
- Me, too.

474
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:50,954
- And we need food.
- And a car.

475
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:51,983
And furniture,

476
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:54,826
so we don't have to sleep
on the floor.

477
00:36:54,827 --> 00:36:56,155
Not that I mind.

478
00:36:56,998 --> 00:36:57,824
God knows your mind,

479
00:36:57,825 --> 00:36:59,124
so you might as well
be honest, Benji.

480
00:36:59,125 --> 00:37:02,128
- All right, all right.
- You wanna pray, Dad?

481
00:37:07,973 --> 00:37:09,036
God...

482
00:37:12,412 --> 00:37:15,009
I don't even really know
where to start.

483
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:23,116
But I ask that you would show
Mum and me, all of us...

484
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:26,262
show us the way.

485
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:32,026
- Amen.
- Amen.

486
00:37:33,231 --> 00:37:34,267
<i>Come on.</i>

487
00:37:38,834 --> 00:37:40,936
Come on, come on,
rattle your dags.

488
00:37:56,487 --> 00:37:57,689
Please be seated.

489
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:02,754
So before we continue

490
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:04,462
our journey through the Psalms,

491
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:06,096
I'm gonna read you
some Sunday announcements.

492
00:38:06,097 --> 00:38:07,026
Sorry. Excuse me.

493
00:38:07,027 --> 00:38:08,232
There's a clothing
and a food drive

494
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:09,396
at the Metro Mission Center...

495
00:38:09,397 --> 00:38:10,500
Sorry. Excuse me.

496
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,537
Taking clothing
and food donations.

497
00:38:12,538 --> 00:38:14,601
And y'all, the youth group
gets back up and running

498
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:17,044
this Wednesday at 6:00 p.m.

499
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,913
And the homeschool
tutorial starts

500
00:38:18,914 --> 00:38:21,677
a week from Monday at 9:00 a.m.

501
00:38:21,678 --> 00:38:24,045
Talk to Kay Albright
if you're interested.

502
00:38:24,046 --> 00:38:27,081
So would you please stand
for the reading of God's Word?

503
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:33,554
"I lift up my eyes
to the mountains.

504
00:38:33,555 --> 00:38:36,326
"Where does my help come from?

505
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:38,966
"My help comes from the Lord,

506
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,733
"the Maker of Heaven and Earth.

507
00:38:47,833 --> 00:38:50,778
"Nashville Homeschool Tutorial."

508
00:38:50,779 --> 00:38:53,081
Homeschooling? Darl.

509
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:54,973
Well, public school
already started.

510
00:38:54,974 --> 00:38:56,546
So, you know,
maybe we just try it

511
00:38:56,547 --> 00:38:58,712
for a semester
and see how it goes?

512
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:01,848
How y'all doin'?
Y'all must be new.

513
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:03,586
We'd have noticed you
before now,

514
00:39:03,587 --> 00:39:04,753
no offense.

515
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:06,652
We do sort of stand out,
don't we?

516
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,388
Are y'all from England?

517
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:09,722
Uh, Australia.

518
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:12,797
Australia. Wish I had an accent.

519
00:39:14,633 --> 00:39:15,862
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

520
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:18,234
Well, I'm Kay.
This is my husband, Jed.

521
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:19,732
- Helen.
- David.

522
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:20,868
- Nice to meet you.
- G'day.

523
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:23,846
My name's Joshua,
but you can call me Josh.

524
00:39:24,903 --> 00:39:26,738
Well, it's good to know, Josh.

525
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:27,873
Are you guys visiting or?

526
00:39:27,874 --> 00:39:29,649
- Oh, this is home...
- Two years.

527
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:33,649
Do you know anything about
the, um, homeschool tutorial?

528
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,383
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, we've got two girls.

529
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:36,783
They just love it.

530
00:39:36,784 --> 00:39:38,757
Are y'all thinking
of joining us?

531
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,119
Yeah, if there's space.

532
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,161
I mean, there are a fair
few of us, though.

533
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:44,859
You don't say.

534
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,493
Tell you what, you need
any help signing up,

535
00:39:47,494 --> 00:39:48,565
anything at all,

536
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:49,969
- you just give me a ring.
- Thank you.

537
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,698
- Yeah.
- Well,

538
00:39:51,699 --> 00:39:53,266
welcome to Nashville, y'all.

539
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:01,373
We're in luck, boys.

540
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:17,229
Hey, Joely, Luke,
let's empty her out.

541
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:23,898
- Hey, neighbor.
- G'day.

542
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:27,271
That's quite a crew
you got there.

543
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:28,705
Yeah, proper cricket team.

544
00:40:28,706 --> 00:40:30,638
Hey,
maybe when you all get done,

545
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,107
you could come do my place?

546
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:35,642
I'm not sure we're quite ready
to take this show on the road...

547
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:36,980
How much would you pay us?

548
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:43,717
$87.80.

549
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:47,886
Could I just put
a couple of things back?

550
00:42:00,897 --> 00:42:03,869
G'day, Smallbone residence.
Dave speaking.

551
00:42:05,974 --> 00:42:07,569
Yeah.

552
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,336
Helen, we got another job!

553
00:42:12,072 --> 00:42:14,743
Mum, how do you spell "cheap"?

554
00:42:14,744 --> 00:42:16,945
- C-H-E...
- Why do you ask, Lukey?

555
00:42:16,946 --> 00:42:20,083
I wanna ask God
to make things more cheap.

556
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:27,354
C-H-E-A...

557
00:42:45,244 --> 00:42:46,582
$93.81.

558
00:43:09,998 --> 00:43:11,669
- Hey, Luke.
- Hey, Dad.

559
00:43:27,988 --> 00:43:29,013
<i>Well, I'm glad you're all</i>

560
00:43:29,014 --> 00:43:30,417
<i>finding your footing.</i>

561
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:33,488
Some of us. Yeah.

562
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:35,825
No, all of you.

563
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,528
It may not be
the way you wanted,

564
00:43:37,529 --> 00:43:39,195
but you're making your way.

565
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,836
The kids are chipping in.

566
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:45,905
Part of it makes me proud.

567
00:43:47,474 --> 00:43:48,974
Part of it makes me sad.

568
00:43:50,004 --> 00:43:51,038
Does it make them sad?

569
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:53,004
I'm not sure
they know any better.

570
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,910
They know enough.

571
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:56,945
And I think
they're onto something.

572
00:43:56,946 --> 00:43:59,017
<i>Any rate,
you have all my prayers.</i>

573
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,586
Thanks. Thanks, Dad.

574
00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:05,082
You'll pull through, son.
Chin up.

575
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:06,486
<i>"If you can dream..."</i>

576
00:44:07,894 --> 00:44:09,758
<i>"And not make dreams
your master..."</i>

577
00:44:09,759 --> 00:44:11,923
"You will be a man, my son."

578
00:44:11,924 --> 00:44:14,032
Yeah. Good on ya.

579
00:44:15,064 --> 00:44:17,134
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Love you, too.

580
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:34,646
Wow, this yard is huge.

581
00:44:35,488 --> 00:44:36,890
So is the house.

582
00:44:42,724 --> 00:44:43,963
Wait up.

583
00:44:48,097 --> 00:44:51,802
G'day. Uh, David Smallbone
from Australia.

584
00:44:51,803 --> 00:44:54,434
I've recently arrived
with my family.

585
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:56,939
Uh, we started a lawn care
and housecleaning business,

586
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,176
wondering if we could
be of service.

587
00:45:00,743 --> 00:45:01,981
Gotta go.

588
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:14,462
The David Smallbone
from Australia

589
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:16,732
is the only David Smallbone
I know.

590
00:45:18,597 --> 00:45:19,597
Eddie DeGarmo.

591
00:45:20,995 --> 00:45:22,599
In the flesh.

592
00:45:24,533 --> 00:45:25,565
I, uh...

593
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,334
Wow.

594
00:45:28,335 --> 00:45:33,378
Yeah. How did you, uh...
How'd you get here?

595
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:36,048
We walked, as usual.

596
00:45:37,077 --> 00:45:38,347
From Australia?

597
00:45:39,189 --> 00:45:41,017
It's a long story.

598
00:45:41,018 --> 00:45:44,050
- I take it the tour went well.
- It did.

599
00:45:44,051 --> 00:45:47,323
Y'all have a beautiful country.

600
00:45:48,055 --> 00:45:49,627
Thanks very much.

601
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:51,190
Uh, well, look, congratulations.

602
00:45:51,191 --> 00:45:53,727
Oh, we'll be off.
Great to see ya.

603
00:45:53,728 --> 00:45:55,094
Come on, kids.

604
00:45:55,095 --> 00:45:56,563
You want the gig or not?

605
00:46:12,816 --> 00:46:14,053
Thank you.

606
00:46:15,854 --> 00:46:17,987
I never said it was ideal.

607
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:19,690
<i>But you don't have real jobs,</i>

608
00:46:19,691 --> 00:46:21,190
<i>you don't even have a car.</i>

609
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:24,162
<i>Just come home.
It's not working over there.</i>

610
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,161
Mum, I know you love me

611
00:46:27,162 --> 00:46:30,002
and I appreciate your concern, truly.

612
00:46:30,003 --> 00:46:36,199
But, these last two months,
I've just seen miracles.

613
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,539
<i>Helen, it's time.</i>

614
00:46:45,282 --> 00:46:47,818
Oh, no, we wouldn't
want to impose.

615
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:50,617
Nonsense!
We'd love to have y'all.

616
00:46:53,454 --> 00:46:55,861
Truth is, um,
we don't have a car

617
00:46:55,862 --> 00:46:58,592
or any real way to, um,
get us all there.

618
00:46:59,962 --> 00:47:01,525
Sure you do, hon.

619
00:47:01,526 --> 00:47:03,668
Jed'll swing by
and pick you all up.

620
00:47:03,669 --> 00:47:05,172
You ain't missing Thanksgiving.

621
00:47:05,173 --> 00:47:06,334
This is America.

622
00:47:10,337 --> 00:47:12,204
Oh, hey, bud.

623
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:13,642
Mum says
we'll be out right away.

624
00:47:13,643 --> 00:47:14,674
Sounds good.

625
00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:26,620
Jed!

626
00:47:28,025 --> 00:47:29,755
Hey, David. How ya doin'?

627
00:47:31,129 --> 00:47:34,228
Uh, good. Good-good.
Getting there.

628
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:36,364
Jed, so sorry
to keep you waiting.

629
00:47:36,365 --> 00:47:39,699
No, it's fine. I'm just...
I'll be right here.

630
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,405
We'll just be one more minute.

631
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:45,809
Grab your jackets.

632
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:48,041
Everybody in the car!

633
00:47:49,112 --> 00:47:51,546
- Just a little taste of home.
- Oh.

634
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:53,212
Jelly?

635
00:47:53,213 --> 00:47:54,951
- Thanks a bunch.
- Thank you.

636
00:47:54,952 --> 00:47:56,215
- My pleasure. Yes.
- Thanks so much!

637
00:47:56,216 --> 00:47:58,021
- Thank you.
- Thanks heaps.

638
00:47:58,022 --> 00:47:59,686
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, no problem.

639
00:48:01,022 --> 00:48:02,326
"Vegemite"?

640
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:21,713
Wow, nice place!

641
00:48:21,714 --> 00:48:22,707
Get out, little monkey.

642
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:25,312
It's like our house back home,
huh, Mum?

643
00:48:25,313 --> 00:48:27,348
- Yes. It's lovely.
- Thanks, y'all.

644
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:29,250
- What's your job?
- Ben, we don't...

645
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:32,616
No, no, it's fine.
I, I write songs.

646
00:48:32,617 --> 00:48:34,930
Oh, great!
Dad's in music, too.

647
00:48:35,596 --> 00:48:37,889
Yeah. So I hear.

648
00:48:40,065 --> 00:48:41,530
Thank you.
Whoa!

649
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,165
What's over here?

650
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,230
Is it okay that they just...

651
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:45,869
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

652
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:49,499
Happy Thanksgiving.

653
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,435
I'm so glad y'all could make it.

654
00:48:51,436 --> 00:48:53,111
Happy Day of Thanksgiving.

655
00:48:53,112 --> 00:48:54,575
Yeah, thanks for having us.

656
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:57,144
- Uh, I'll take your coats.
- Make yourselves at home.

657
00:48:57,145 --> 00:48:58,950
There are snacks in the kitchen

658
00:48:58,951 --> 00:49:00,083
and, kids,
you all can head upstairs

659
00:49:00,084 --> 00:49:01,215
to the game room,
if you want or...

660
00:49:01,216 --> 00:49:02,820
- Game room?
- Be good.

661
00:49:02,821 --> 00:49:05,118
Yeah, come on in.

662
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,187
Y'all are gonna leave here

663
00:49:06,188 --> 00:49:07,886
fuller than a tick
on a coonhound.

664
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,463
Thanks very much.

665
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:19,366
<i>Our most loving Father,</i>

666
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:21,234
we thank you
for our many blessings,

667
00:49:21,235 --> 00:49:24,505
our dear friends, old and new.

668
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:27,272
We thank you for this
delicious feast before us.

669
00:49:27,273 --> 00:49:29,412
- Amen.
- Amen.

670
00:50:06,152 --> 00:50:07,946
Amen.

671
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:15,822
Hey, you all right?

672
00:50:18,593 --> 00:50:20,695
Seems like they could
use some help.

673
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:29,404
That is the biggest chicken
I've ever seen.

674
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:31,673
It's no chicken, sweetie,
it's an ostrich.

675
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:37,046
So, Kay tells me
you're a promoter.

676
00:50:37,047 --> 00:50:39,147
Oh, once upon a time, yeah.

677
00:50:39,148 --> 00:50:40,979
You know someone
looking for one?

678
00:50:42,222 --> 00:50:44,389
Well, I may know somebody
who should be.

679
00:50:51,397 --> 00:50:53,926
Oh, darl, can't just throw her
to the wolves.

680
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:57,270
I wouldn't underestimate her...

681
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,470
or any of them.

682
00:51:04,372 --> 00:51:05,473
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

683
00:51:05,474 --> 00:51:07,140
- You have a good night.
- Good night.

684
00:51:08,542 --> 00:51:10,175
Hey, thank you so much
for having us.

685
00:51:10,176 --> 00:51:11,347
Our pleasure.

686
00:51:11,348 --> 00:51:12,711
Yeah, I think the kids
are a bit knackered.

687
00:51:12,712 --> 00:51:14,817
Could we trouble you
to give us a ride home?

688
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:15,849
Here ya go.

689
00:51:17,351 --> 00:51:18,386
Oh, Jed,

690
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:20,656
- we can't borrow your van.
- I mean...

691
00:51:21,555 --> 00:51:23,358
Well, Kay and I had a chat,

692
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,563
and the way we see it,
it's yours now.

693
00:51:28,796 --> 00:51:30,967
- I... Mate, that's kind...
- Oh, no,

694
00:51:30,968 --> 00:51:32,034
we don't have insurance.

695
00:51:32,035 --> 00:51:34,403
Let 'em sue me.

696
00:51:34,404 --> 00:51:37,139
I think God wants us
to give you the van.

697
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,340
We'll sort the rest out later.

698
00:51:56,791 --> 00:51:58,422
Dad,
turn on the cassette player!

699
00:51:58,423 --> 00:51:59,493
Turn on the radio!

700
00:51:59,494 --> 00:52:01,063
Oh, yeah, yeah!
No, play that.

701
00:52:01,064 --> 00:52:02,728
Play the cassette, please.

702
00:52:02,729 --> 00:52:04,965
No, it's got a cassette player
and a CD player.

703
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:12,875
Happy Thanksgiving, darling.

704
00:52:12,876 --> 00:52:13,876
You too, darl.

705
00:52:34,726 --> 00:52:37,598
All right, there.
You've got this.

706
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,471
You'll be all right.
Just make it your own.

707
00:52:40,335 --> 00:52:41,905
Hit it, boys.

708
00:52:54,245 --> 00:52:56,383
All right, stop. Stop.

709
00:52:56,384 --> 00:52:57,552
What?

710
00:52:57,553 --> 00:52:59,183
Sweetie, what's this?
What are you doing?

711
00:52:59,184 --> 00:53:00,857
Oh.

712
00:53:00,858 --> 00:53:02,659
Moving my hand.

713
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,124
Oh, well, just try to move it
more like a normal person.

714
00:53:07,331 --> 00:53:09,327
I mean, just don't try so hard.

715
00:53:09,328 --> 00:53:11,331
You know, relax.

716
00:53:11,332 --> 00:53:12,635
Let's give it another go.

717
00:53:22,676 --> 00:53:24,942
All right.
That's really nice, boys.

718
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:27,182
But that's... that's enough.

719
00:53:27,183 --> 00:53:28,515
Let's give it another go.

720
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:30,555
- I want a record deal.
- So do I.

721
00:53:31,387 --> 00:53:33,353
Yeah, well, get in line.

722
00:53:33,354 --> 00:53:34,952
All right, from the top.

723
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:39,423
Just relax. Yeah. Yeah, no.

724
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:51,037
<i>Yeah, I don't know what it is.</i>

725
00:53:51,038 --> 00:53:54,710
When she sings and thinks
no one's watching, she shines.

726
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:57,978
But then in those rehearsals,
the spark's just...

727
00:53:59,084 --> 00:54:00,145
It's just gone.

728
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,418
Well, it can't be easy,

729
00:54:04,419 --> 00:54:06,853
performing under critical eyes.

730
00:54:06,854 --> 00:54:08,989
It's only gonna get harder
from here, darling.

731
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:12,465
Just give her time.

732
00:54:16,631 --> 00:54:18,273
Another thing we can't afford.

733
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,805
Mum! Mum!

734
00:54:24,110 --> 00:54:25,110
What's this?

735
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,109
Oh.

736
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:29,548
Christmas list.

737
00:54:33,153 --> 00:54:34,988
Money's tight, boys.

738
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:36,489
Santa doesn't care
that we're poor.

739
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:38,820
True.

740
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,322
But because we moved,
he might not know where we live.

741
00:54:41,323 --> 00:54:43,590
What? You didn't tell him?

742
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:44,956
Why didn't you tell him
we moved?

743
00:54:44,957 --> 00:54:46,857
- That's enough, Joel.
- We have to pray.

744
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:48,793
It doesn't work like that.

745
00:54:48,794 --> 00:54:50,629
We've prayed
for everything else.

746
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:51,867
Why can't we pray for this?

747
00:54:53,037 --> 00:54:54,037
Look.

748
00:54:55,078 --> 00:54:57,273
We promised
to be honest with you.

749
00:54:57,274 --> 00:54:59,574
It's time you knew.

750
00:54:59,575 --> 00:55:01,805
- There's...
- Yes, it's time you knew

751
00:55:01,806 --> 00:55:04,115
what Mum wants for Christmas.

752
00:55:04,116 --> 00:55:06,951
A washing machine and a dryer.

753
00:55:08,813 --> 00:55:10,985
- Who wants to pray?
- I will.

754
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:16,459
Jesus, I bet you
and St. Nick are good friends.

755
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,688
So if you could
give him our address,

756
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:20,024
we'd be very glad.

757
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,329
And please give Mum
a washer and dryer.

758
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:24,200
- Amen.
- Amen.

759
00:55:24,201 --> 00:55:25,802
Amen. Okay, take that

760
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:27,834
and get the others to write
what they want, as well, okay?

761
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:29,503
Guys, Santa needs to know

762
00:55:29,504 --> 00:55:31,473
what you want for Christmas!

763
00:55:31,474 --> 00:55:34,107
I'm sorry, David.
I just couldn't.

764
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:37,550
If not now then when, darl?

765
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:39,882
Christmas morning?

766
00:55:47,562 --> 00:55:48,618
<i>Ooh!</i>

767
00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:50,024
It's freezing.

768
00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:53,123
Those wintery Christmas carols
now make a lot more sense.

769
00:55:53,124 --> 00:55:55,168
Well, I can't imagine
Christmas in the summer.

770
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:57,864
That seems so wrong.

771
00:56:04,609 --> 00:56:06,243
They always have the funniest
little knickknacks

772
00:56:06,244 --> 00:56:07,604
to put in all the stockings.

773
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:09,780
Yeah.

774
00:56:12,446 --> 00:56:13,652
May I?

775
00:56:18,587 --> 00:56:20,689
Oh, honey, you're, uh,

776
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,859
you're not gonna find
much of this here.

777
00:56:27,562 --> 00:56:29,129
Yeah, I see that.

778
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:37,241
Grab a spoon.
Go and get the cream.

779
00:56:37,242 --> 00:56:38,571
Oh, yeah, get the cream.

780
00:56:38,572 --> 00:56:40,508
Can he get it?

781
00:56:42,145 --> 00:56:43,843
Yeah!

782
00:56:43,844 --> 00:56:45,380
On the cookie, can he land it?

783
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:46,450
Come on, Joshie!

784
00:56:46,451 --> 00:56:47,584
Yes, all right, all right.

785
00:56:47,585 --> 00:56:49,683
- You're doing great.
- Thank you.

786
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,084
Danny, put the sprinkles

787
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:56,358
on the cookie!

788
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:57,696
Oh, I'll get it.

789
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,025
- I'll come, too.
- Who could that be?

790
00:57:01,026 --> 00:57:03,563
I don't know.
Maybe it's carolers.

791
00:57:03,564 --> 00:57:04,934
They do that in America.

792
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:07,232
Santa!

793
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:10,575
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.

794
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:12,810
- Merry Christmas.
- Santa! Look, Dad, it's Santa!

795
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:15,239
Back at ya, bud.

796
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:17,942
- Presents!
- Merry Christmas, Smallbones.

797
00:57:17,943 --> 00:57:20,015
Joy to the world, y'all.

798
00:57:30,063 --> 00:57:31,724
A washer!

799
00:57:52,284 --> 00:57:53,284
Thank you, Jed.

800
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:58,115
No, man, Kay's the one who...

801
00:57:58,116 --> 00:58:01,390
Well, the church and Santa,
of course.

802
00:58:01,391 --> 00:58:02,420
What did I tell you, Mum?

803
00:59:35,882 --> 00:59:37,889
David, it's time.

804
00:59:38,588 --> 00:59:39,594
What's that, darl?

805
00:59:40,557 --> 00:59:41,557
David.

806
00:59:44,396 --> 00:59:45,396
Are you sure?

807
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:48,498
Right.

808
00:59:48,499 --> 00:59:51,466
Kids, Mum's gonna have the baby.

809
00:59:51,467 --> 00:59:52,534
Now? What?

810
00:59:53,701 --> 00:59:54,935
Come say goodbye.

811
00:59:54,936 --> 00:59:56,369
We'll be back
in a couple of days.

812
01:00:06,118 --> 01:00:08,149
- Okay, Helen...
- Something feels different.

813
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:10,684
Take a deep
breath and one more push.

814
01:00:10,685 --> 01:00:12,051
Okay, you can do this.

815
01:00:12,052 --> 01:00:14,183
You've got this.

816
01:00:14,184 --> 01:00:16,690
Ready? You've got this, okay?

817
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:40,877
Congratulations,
it's a beautiful baby girl.

818
01:00:40,878 --> 01:00:44,351
Oh! Hi, baby!

819
01:00:44,751 --> 01:00:45,993
Oh!

820
01:00:47,053 --> 01:00:49,120
It's little American girl.

821
01:00:49,121 --> 01:00:51,666
She looks
true-blue Aussie to me.

822
01:00:52,631 --> 01:00:54,531
You can tell by her accent.

823
01:00:54,532 --> 01:00:57,466
Little Elizabeth.

824
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,032
Hi, little Libby.

825
01:00:59,033 --> 01:01:02,968
Now we have bookends.
Two girls.

826
01:01:04,769 --> 01:01:06,743
Am I okay?

827
01:01:06,744 --> 01:01:10,310
- You did great.
- Oh, David.

828
01:01:10,311 --> 01:01:12,976
Helen,
we need to clear the placenta.

829
01:01:12,977 --> 01:01:14,650
One more push, okay?

830
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,856
- Helen. Darling.
- No.

831
01:01:22,857 --> 01:01:24,760
- What's going on?
- David.

832
01:01:24,761 --> 01:01:26,123
- What's happening?
- David.

833
01:01:26,124 --> 01:01:28,532
What's wrong? What's wrong?

834
01:01:49,721 --> 01:01:52,356
Stay with me. Stay with me.

835
01:01:52,357 --> 01:01:54,993
Hey. Don't leave me.

836
01:01:57,859 --> 01:01:59,393
Don't leave me.

837
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:27,520
Helen.

838
01:02:29,262 --> 01:02:30,262
Darling.

839
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:38,668
Where's Libby?

840
01:02:38,669 --> 01:02:40,599
Oh, she's fine. The baby's fine.

841
01:02:42,704 --> 01:02:43,743
What?

842
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:46,173
The, uh, doctor was worried
about the bleeding.

843
01:02:46,174 --> 01:02:48,007
She wants you
to stay a few days to rest.

844
01:02:48,008 --> 01:02:50,178
Oh, no. I can't. We can't stay

845
01:02:50,179 --> 01:02:52,109
- 'cause of the cost.
- Hey, don't worry about it.

846
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:53,650
I'm gonna be all right.

847
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:55,479
Sweetie, don't worry about it.

848
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:58,283
We've got a healthy,
beautiful baby girl.

849
01:02:58,284 --> 01:03:00,454
That's all that matters.

850
01:03:02,728 --> 01:03:04,488
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, darl.

851
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:09,226
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey. No. Listen to me.

852
01:03:09,227 --> 01:03:13,030
I'll take care of it. I promise.

853
01:03:13,031 --> 01:03:14,868
I'll sort it out.

854
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:17,141
- You just rest.
- Okay.

855
01:03:21,615 --> 01:03:24,148
- I love you.
- I love you.

856
01:03:38,561 --> 01:03:43,064
<i>Look, I'd pay it all
if I could, but I can't.</i>

857
01:03:43,065 --> 01:03:44,594
<i>We don't have insurance yet
and...</i>

858
01:03:44,595 --> 01:03:47,971
<i>Mr. Smallbone,
refusal to pay...</i>

859
01:03:47,972 --> 01:03:49,733
<i>Oh, look,
I'm not refusing to pay.</i>

860
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:52,737
Just asking you to let me pay
what I actually can.

861
01:03:54,512 --> 01:03:55,512
Please.

862
01:04:00,414 --> 01:04:02,916
Well, let's look
at payment options.

863
01:04:02,917 --> 01:04:04,518
What can you pay today?

864
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:07,359
I...

865
01:04:08,056 --> 01:04:10,524
I could do $200 a month.

866
01:04:14,065 --> 01:04:18,136
How about $250 a month
for a year?

867
01:04:20,738 --> 01:04:24,175
So, $3,000 total?

868
01:04:25,272 --> 01:04:27,244
And we'll consider it settled.

869
01:04:29,452 --> 01:04:31,347
I think I can manage that.

870
01:04:34,752 --> 01:04:35,780
I'll come through.

871
01:04:37,581 --> 01:04:39,954
All right.
Just give me a second, here.

872
01:04:39,955 --> 01:04:41,925
Thank you. Thank you very much.

873
01:04:41,926 --> 01:04:43,355
Mm-hmm.

874
01:04:46,598 --> 01:04:47,893
Oh.

875
01:04:47,894 --> 01:04:49,299
That's weird.

876
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,830
Says here
it's been paid in full.

877
01:04:58,378 --> 01:04:59,474
By who?

878
01:05:03,074 --> 01:05:04,413
Doesn't say.

879
01:05:06,382 --> 01:05:08,582
Looks like you have
a guardian angel.

880
01:05:13,888 --> 01:05:15,991
Mum! Mum!

881
01:05:18,391 --> 01:05:20,629
Oh, gentle, gentle, Mummy.

882
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,625
Missed you guys.

883
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,326
- Hi. You doing okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

884
01:05:23,327 --> 01:05:24,396
Dad's here, too.

885
01:05:24,397 --> 01:05:26,001
Do you wanna meet your sister?

886
01:05:26,002 --> 01:05:28,433
Oh, she's so cute.
What's her name?

887
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:30,004
Elizabeth.
Libby, for short.

888
01:05:30,005 --> 01:05:31,440
All right, it's cold.

889
01:05:31,441 --> 01:05:32,635
- Let's get everyone inside.
- Yeah, let's get inside.

890
01:05:32,636 --> 01:05:35,442
- Can I take her?
- Okay. Thank you.

891
01:05:35,443 --> 01:05:37,141
How are you, guys?
You feeling okay?

892
01:05:37,142 --> 01:05:38,480
Yeah, good.

893
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:41,219
Need a hand?

894
01:05:41,951 --> 01:05:43,514
I can manage.

895
01:05:43,515 --> 01:05:47,152
So glad Helen's okay.
The baby, too.

896
01:05:47,153 --> 01:05:49,556
- Yeah.
- Thank God.

897
01:05:49,557 --> 01:05:52,490
Hey, your kids are just great.
I mean, what a joy.

898
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:55,327
Kay and I,
we just love 'em to death.

899
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:57,499
They all think
you're just grand.

900
01:05:57,999 --> 01:05:59,465
A real hero.

901
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:01,701
- Here, let me help you.
- I said I can manage.

902
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:04,737
You okay?

903
01:06:05,845 --> 01:06:08,308
I know you paid the bill.

904
01:06:08,309 --> 01:06:09,579
I don't know
what you're talking about.

905
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,046
Yes, you do.

906
01:06:11,047 --> 01:06:12,247
- And it's too much.
- Oh, look...

907
01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:14,516
I told her I'd take care of it.
I promised.

908
01:06:19,254 --> 01:06:20,753
I thought I'd lost her, Jed.

909
01:06:23,399 --> 01:06:25,127
Hey, I'm sorry.

910
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:26,823
Kay and I,
we're just trying to help.

911
01:06:26,824 --> 01:06:29,399
You know, it's not just that
you paid the bill.

912
01:06:30,265 --> 01:06:31,933
It's that you gave them double.

913
01:06:31,934 --> 01:06:34,037
I had them down to $3,000.

914
01:06:34,038 --> 01:06:36,337
I'd finally done
something worthwhile,

915
01:06:36,338 --> 01:06:38,573
and you didn't even
give me the chance.

916
01:06:38,574 --> 01:06:42,279
You just threw money at it!
You throw money at everything.

917
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,911
Look, if you wanna help us,
please just back off.

918
01:06:48,821 --> 01:06:50,288
You gotta back off.

919
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:20,978
Very nice.
Miss Smallbone, thanks.

920
01:07:22,184 --> 01:07:23,387
We'll let you know.

921
01:07:25,325 --> 01:07:26,526
<i>Yeah, forget other folks.</i>

922
01:07:26,527 --> 01:07:27,985
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

923
01:07:27,986 --> 01:07:33,593
<i>You'll always be my favorite
granddaughter named Rebecca.</i>

924
01:07:33,594 --> 01:07:36,463
Yeah. Thanks, Grandpa James.

925
01:07:36,464 --> 01:07:38,831
God makes everything beautiful
in its time.

926
01:07:40,266 --> 01:07:42,637
Yeah. Right.

927
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,108
Oh, here's Dad.

928
01:07:48,109 --> 01:07:50,246
<i>I love you, very much.</i>

929
01:07:50,247 --> 01:07:52,479
And I, you.

930
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:54,352
<i>All right, Dad,
we'll let you go.</i>

931
01:07:55,883 --> 01:07:59,485
- She's a special one, David.
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

932
01:07:59,486 --> 01:08:01,925
Trick is getting other folks
to see it.

933
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:03,526
Nothing seems to be working.

934
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:05,521
I'm just staying what
everyone's gonna be thinking.

935
01:08:05,522 --> 01:08:06,691
Does anybody really care

936
01:08:06,692 --> 01:08:08,960
what a 16-year-old girl
thinks about life?

937
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:11,133
Or God?

938
01:08:11,134 --> 01:08:13,629
Or anything else,
for that matter?

939
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:15,868
I know what I believe, sir.

940
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,667
Sure.

941
01:08:18,668 --> 01:08:20,510
Come back when you look like it.

942
01:08:21,177 --> 01:08:22,644
I don't think we will.

943
01:08:25,878 --> 01:08:28,852
<i>Be with Bec at her auditions.</i>

944
01:08:28,853 --> 01:08:30,012
Help her to sing better,

945
01:08:30,013 --> 01:08:33,682
and fix her hands
so she can get a record deal.

946
01:08:33,683 --> 01:08:35,386
<i>Please help us make money,</i>

947
01:08:35,387 --> 01:08:36,721
<i>even in the winter...</i>

948
01:08:36,722 --> 01:08:39,031
<i>Be with Dad
as he looks for another job.</i>

949
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:41,128
I promise
I'll work harder than anyone.

950
01:08:41,129 --> 01:08:42,364
I have no doubt you would.

951
01:08:42,365 --> 01:08:44,561
But with these
visa restrictions, I don't...

952
01:08:44,562 --> 01:08:45,828
Sorry, I can't be more help.

953
01:08:45,829 --> 01:08:48,605
It's all right.
You need your rest.

954
01:08:48,606 --> 01:08:49,671
Yeah.

955
01:08:51,004 --> 01:08:52,705
<i>It's fine eyeing the horizon,</i>

956
01:08:52,706 --> 01:08:55,308
<i>just don't miss
what's right in front of you.</i>

957
01:08:55,309 --> 01:08:56,839
<i>Easy for you to say.</i>

958
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,181
<i>I'm over here
in the thick of it,</i>

959
01:08:58,182 --> 01:08:59,247
trying to figure out
right-side up

960
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:00,645
from upside-down.

961
01:09:00,646 --> 01:09:03,252
I only meant,
"If you can dream..."

962
01:09:03,253 --> 01:09:05,053
<i>I'm not saying the poem, Dad.</i>

963
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:06,256
Appreciate the sentiment

964
01:09:06,257 --> 01:09:09,222
but that's all it is,
is just sentiment.

965
01:09:09,223 --> 01:09:10,388
Have fun on your date.

966
01:09:10,389 --> 01:09:12,492
All right, let's go play.

967
01:09:12,493 --> 01:09:14,129
<i>The more I think about it,</i>

968
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:16,263
the more I wonder if he's right.

969
01:09:16,264 --> 01:09:18,997
Maybe I'm not meant to sing.

970
01:09:18,998 --> 01:09:22,638
Or maybe you're not meant
to sing other people's songs.

971
01:09:24,042 --> 01:09:25,608
I'm not a songwriter.

972
01:09:27,874 --> 01:09:31,673
Bec, you have been given
a beautiful voice.

973
01:09:31,674 --> 01:09:33,385
And you have a good heart.

974
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:36,946
<i>You could do anything.</i>

975
01:09:36,947 --> 01:09:40,623
<i>Just make sure
it's the real you that does it.</i>

976
01:09:43,523 --> 01:09:45,495
Dad, I wrote a song.

977
01:09:45,496 --> 01:09:47,557
Thought maybe we could try it
at the next audition.

978
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:48,991
Oh, that's great, honey.

979
01:09:48,992 --> 01:09:51,496
Let's take it
one step at a time.

980
01:09:51,497 --> 01:09:52,632
<i>David,</i>

981
01:09:52,633 --> 01:09:54,268
<i>just don't make
the same mistake I did.</i>

982
01:09:54,269 --> 01:09:56,004
<i>Took me too long to realize...</i>

983
01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:56,934
Look, I gotta go.

984
01:09:56,935 --> 01:10:00,973
Son, your family,
they're not in the way.

985
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,113
They are the way.

986
01:10:06,246 --> 01:10:07,419
Yeah.

987
01:10:20,664 --> 01:10:22,899
Oh, but you can't take
that stuff seriously, dude.

988
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,926
That's just Kevin.

989
01:10:23,927 --> 01:10:26,504
He's a loose cannon.
I told you that.

990
01:10:27,168 --> 01:10:28,432
Uh-huh.

991
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,167
I understand that.

992
01:10:31,205 --> 01:10:32,240
Yeah.

993
01:10:32,241 --> 01:10:34,209
Um, when you're all done here,

994
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,340
Susan will get you squared away.

995
01:10:36,341 --> 01:10:37,474
Cash, right?

996
01:10:37,475 --> 01:10:38,912
- Yes.
- Yeah.

997
01:10:38,913 --> 01:10:39,845
Huh?

998
01:10:39,846 --> 01:10:42,985
No, no, just talking
to the cleaning guy.

999
01:10:42,986 --> 01:10:44,287
No, I'm just saying,

1000
01:10:44,288 --> 01:10:46,051
don't take it personally,
that's all.

1001
01:11:32,132 --> 01:11:35,204
You know, Mr. DeGarmo
started a record label.

1002
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:36,304
Really?
Yeah.

1003
01:11:36,305 --> 01:11:37,367
Did you know that, David?

1004
01:11:37,368 --> 01:11:38,669
I did.

1005
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,836
Mummy, I want a little Band-Aid.

1006
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:42,241
Oh, you're not bleeding, darling.

1007
01:11:42,242 --> 01:11:43,680
But it stings.

1008
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:47,282
Okay. Well, a Band-Aid is not
gonna make it not sting. Okay?

1009
01:11:47,283 --> 01:11:49,614
Here. All better. Okay?

1010
01:11:49,615 --> 01:11:51,288
Okay.

1011
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:52,958
You never told me
that about Eddie.

1012
01:11:52,959 --> 01:11:55,986
- Oh, no?
- Mum, I'm hungry.

1013
01:11:55,987 --> 01:11:57,658
Yeah, well,
dinner's nearly ready.

1014
01:11:57,659 --> 01:12:00,331
Why don't you take the bowls,
set the table.

1015
01:12:00,332 --> 01:12:02,661
- Ramen again?
- Yes. Bowls, Joel.

1016
01:12:02,662 --> 01:12:03,727
And, Ben,
can you get the cutlery?

1017
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:05,035
Danny, you can help as well.

1018
01:12:05,036 --> 01:12:06,270
No, I'd have remembered

1019
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:07,433
you telling me
something like that.

1020
01:12:07,434 --> 01:12:08,734
That's incredible. I mean,

1021
01:12:08,735 --> 01:12:09,967
right under our noses
this whole time.

1022
01:12:09,968 --> 01:12:12,472
Don't you think
that's incredible, David?

1023
01:12:12,473 --> 01:12:14,340
Mum, my robot needs batteries.

1024
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:15,411
It's broken, Luke.

1025
01:12:15,412 --> 01:12:16,545
You'll just have to pretend, darling.

1026
01:12:16,546 --> 01:12:19,110
I thought we could ask him
for an audition,

1027
01:12:19,111 --> 01:12:20,810
- since he's a friend.
- Yeah, I don't see why not.

1028
01:12:20,811 --> 01:12:23,145
I don't think it's a good idea.

1029
01:12:23,146 --> 01:12:25,147
- Mum, please.
- There's no batteries, Luke.

1030
01:12:25,148 --> 01:12:26,485
Okay, you just go
and sit at the table.

1031
01:12:26,486 --> 01:12:27,655
Why isn't it a good idea?

1032
01:12:27,656 --> 01:12:30,295
Look. We've got
the Word Records audition.

1033
01:12:30,296 --> 01:12:32,287
I say we focus on that.
I feel good about it.

1034
01:12:32,288 --> 01:12:34,258
Yeah, but we felt good
about other ones, too, so,

1035
01:12:34,259 --> 01:12:35,893
if it doesn't work out, I just
thought that Mr. DeGarmo...

1036
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:37,160
I don't think
it's the right fit.

1037
01:12:37,161 --> 01:12:39,598
Well, beggars can't
be choosers, David.

1038
01:12:39,599 --> 01:12:41,837
We're not all beggars, Helen.

1039
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:44,801
What is that supposed to mean?

1040
01:12:44,802 --> 01:12:47,069
It means I know this business.

1041
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,611
And I'm not begging Eddie
or anyone.

1042
01:12:49,612 --> 01:12:50,977
Yeah, but I'm not asking you
to beg, Dad.

1043
01:12:50,978 --> 01:12:52,779
I just thought we could talk
to him since he's a friend

1044
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,045
- and not just give up.
- He's not your friend.

1045
01:12:54,046 --> 01:12:55,949
But why not just give it a go.
I don't understand

1046
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:58,070
- why you won't even try...
- Because you're his maid!

1047
01:13:05,462 --> 01:13:07,225
You're just his maid, Bec.

1048
01:13:08,432 --> 01:13:09,832
That's all you are to him.

1049
01:13:21,412 --> 01:13:23,611
Bec. Look, I only meant...

1050
01:13:23,612 --> 01:13:24,973
You bite her head off
for trying.

1051
01:13:24,974 --> 01:13:26,746
You're being too hard on her.

1052
01:13:26,747 --> 01:13:29,847
Compared to what, Helen?
Compared to you?

1053
01:13:29,848 --> 01:13:31,715
I wanted to protect her
from this,

1054
01:13:31,716 --> 01:13:32,981
but you pushed for it.

1055
01:13:32,982 --> 01:13:34,851
So now someone's gotta teach her

1056
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:36,086
and all of them to face facts.

1057
01:13:36,087 --> 01:13:37,925
You don't need to tell me
that I'm a bad mum

1058
01:13:37,926 --> 01:13:39,724
'cause I already feel like
I'm failing them every day.

1059
01:13:39,725 --> 01:13:41,497
No one thinks you're a bad mum.

1060
01:13:41,498 --> 01:13:43,365
Everyone knows
who the real failure is.

1061
01:13:43,366 --> 01:13:44,533
- Oh, such pride.
- Oh!

1062
01:13:44,534 --> 01:13:45,661
- So much pride!
- Yeah, right.

1063
01:13:45,662 --> 01:13:46,866
So much pride

1064
01:13:46,867 --> 01:13:48,934
that I just scrubbed
Eddie DeGarmo's toilet.

1065
01:13:48,935 --> 01:13:50,671
But, hey, if that's
not degrading enough,

1066
01:13:50,672 --> 01:13:52,241
now I have to go down
on bended knee

1067
01:13:52,242 --> 01:13:53,402
asking for a record deal?

1068
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:56,776
- She just wants an audition.
- That's not the point.

1069
01:13:56,777 --> 01:13:59,041
I'm trying to protect her,
to spare her

1070
01:13:59,042 --> 01:14:00,316
from humiliation.

1071
01:14:00,317 --> 01:14:01,649
But that means nothing to you.

1072
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:02,911
It's nothing for you
to go begging

1073
01:14:02,912 --> 01:14:04,715
for presents or furniture.

1074
01:14:04,716 --> 01:14:05,818
What was I supposed to do,

1075
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:07,182
- just turn them away?
- Oh, right.

1076
01:14:07,183 --> 01:14:08,558
Let Christmas come
and go to spare you?

1077
01:14:08,559 --> 01:14:10,087
They just magically showed up
in our yard...

1078
01:14:10,088 --> 01:14:11,889
Do you pay attention
to anyone but yourself?

1079
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:13,823
Gifts in hand.
Another miracle.

1080
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:15,993
It was a miracle. It was!

1081
01:14:15,994 --> 01:14:17,629
No, it wasn't lightning
from the sky.

1082
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:19,535
It was an answered prayer.

1083
01:14:19,536 --> 01:14:20,601
And would it kill you
to be grateful?

1084
01:14:20,602 --> 01:14:22,371
- I was grateful! I was!
- Oh, yes.

1085
01:14:22,372 --> 01:14:23,232
Am I not allowed to feel

1086
01:14:23,233 --> 01:14:24,607
more than one thing
at the same time?

1087
01:14:24,608 --> 01:14:26,211
That's one thing
we don't allow in our house,

1088
01:14:26,212 --> 01:14:28,177
is room for you
and your feelings.

1089
01:14:28,178 --> 01:14:29,040
They just showed up

1090
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:30,340
with their pity
and their judgment.

1091
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:33,883
- No one is judging us.
- They're judging me, Helen!

1092
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:38,488
You are not protecting her.

1093
01:14:38,489 --> 01:14:40,021
You're not protecting
any of them.

1094
01:14:40,022 --> 01:14:43,761
You're protecting your pride.
And it's holding them back.

1095
01:14:44,861 --> 01:14:46,825
Just because
you had your dreams dashed

1096
01:14:46,826 --> 01:14:48,363
doesn't mean
I'm gonna stand here

1097
01:14:48,364 --> 01:14:50,394
and let you crush theirs.

1098
01:14:53,339 --> 01:14:54,706
You think I'm too hard on you?

1099
01:14:56,134 --> 01:14:59,869
- Bec, do you?
- David.

1100
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,676
No. She needs to hear

1101
01:15:01,677 --> 01:15:04,307
what I wish to God
someone had told me.

1102
01:15:04,308 --> 01:15:07,112
People in this industry,
they're not your friends.

1103
01:15:07,113 --> 01:15:10,683
They do not care about you
or what happens to you.

1104
01:15:10,684 --> 01:15:11,749
- David.
- They only care about

1105
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,216
what you can do for them.

1106
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:15,726
And it's not enough.
It will never be enough.

1107
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:20,798
- You will never be enough!
- David! Stop it! Get out.

1108
01:15:21,763 --> 01:15:23,867
You need to leave. Leave!

1109
01:17:03,426 --> 01:17:06,703
We see a lot of potential
here, Rebecca.

1110
01:17:06,704 --> 01:17:09,704
With the right direction
and the right team,

1111
01:17:09,705 --> 01:17:11,539
we think that we might
be looking

1112
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:14,076
at the next Amy Grant.

1113
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:15,543
Oh.

1114
01:17:16,448 --> 01:17:17,975
Thanks heaps.

1115
01:17:17,976 --> 01:17:19,243
- And the accent.
- It's so cute.

1116
01:17:19,244 --> 01:17:20,712
- The accent, it...
- It's adorable.

1117
01:17:20,713 --> 01:17:22,050
It's so charming.

1118
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:23,348
"That's not a knife."

1119
01:17:23,349 --> 01:17:25,180
- Yes. Yes.
- "Now that's a knife." Right?

1120
01:17:25,181 --> 01:17:26,654
<i>- Crocodile Dundee.</i>
- Oh, yes!

1121
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:29,051
It's really, really good. Yeah.

1122
01:17:29,052 --> 01:17:31,929
Yeah. Yeah.

1123
01:17:33,059 --> 01:17:34,490
So, (CLEARS THROAT) here it is.

1124
01:17:34,491 --> 01:17:38,430
We are prepared to offer you
a development deal.

1125
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:41,540
Yes, you cut five tracks
for an advance of $10,000.

1126
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:45,035
And if all goes well
and we think it will,

1127
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,405
we're looking at a full record.

1128
01:17:52,981 --> 01:17:54,443
She doesn't believe it.
Did she hear me?

1129
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:56,119
- Yeah, nah...
- Full record.

1130
01:17:57,282 --> 01:17:58,653
<i>All right, three cheers for Bec.</i>

1131
01:17:58,654 --> 01:18:00,556
- Hip! Hip!
- Hurray!

1132
01:18:00,557 --> 01:18:04,254
Hip! Hip!
Hurray!

1133
01:18:04,255 --> 01:18:05,526
Here's for the lady of the hour.

1134
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:06,623
Thank you so much.

1135
01:18:07,893 --> 01:18:08,928
Hey.

1136
01:18:16,505 --> 01:18:17,669
Ah!

1137
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:19,276
Record deal!

1138
01:18:49,802 --> 01:18:51,008
Hello?

1139
01:18:51,973 --> 01:18:53,739
<i>David?</i>

1140
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:56,211
Nana. You all right?

1141
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:00,816
I, I'll, I'll put Helen on.

1142
01:19:00,817 --> 01:19:03,482
<i>No, David, no.
I'm calling for you.</i>

1143
01:19:04,688 --> 01:19:06,958
<i>It's James, your dad.</i>

1144
01:19:08,294 --> 01:19:10,021
<i>He's gone.</i>

1145
01:19:10,022 --> 01:19:12,062
What do you mean he's gone?

1146
01:19:12,495 --> 01:19:13,525
<i>He...</i>

1147
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:16,297
<i>He passed away.</i>

1148
01:19:17,063 --> 01:19:19,036
<i>I'm so sorry, David.</i>

1149
01:19:30,543 --> 01:19:34,048
I know we talked about
sending the advance next week,

1150
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:36,355
but I was wondering
if there's any chance

1151
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,254
we could speed things along.

1152
01:19:38,255 --> 01:19:39,181
Uh...

1153
01:19:39,182 --> 01:19:40,449
Something's come up.

1154
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:42,823
I've gotta get back
to Australia.

1155
01:19:42,824 --> 01:19:43,992
We don't need the full amount...

1156
01:19:43,993 --> 01:19:45,292
<i>Gotta be honest with you, David.</i>

1157
01:19:45,293 --> 01:19:48,897
<i>Sandy and I got to talking
and Rebecca's great.</i>

1158
01:19:48,898 --> 01:19:50,961
<i>We think she has
a bright future.</i>

1159
01:19:50,962 --> 01:19:52,430
We agree on that.

1160
01:19:52,431 --> 01:19:54,563
<i>We just need to give it
some time on our end,</i>

1161
01:19:54,564 --> 01:19:57,070
<i>maybe we talk again
in a year or two</i>

1162
01:19:57,071 --> 01:19:59,575
<i>- when she's further along.</i>
- Uh...

1163
01:19:59,576 --> 01:20:00,846
She's a quick learner.

1164
01:20:00,847 --> 01:20:04,812
She's come such a long way
in a short amount of time.

1165
01:20:04,813 --> 01:20:06,643
You've seen she's a natural.

1166
01:20:06,644 --> 01:20:11,113
<i>Yeah. Yeah. It's...
It's just not the right time.</i>

1167
01:20:11,114 --> 01:20:12,648
I can work with her.

1168
01:20:12,649 --> 01:20:15,453
- Let me work with her.
- David, what's the matter?

1169
01:20:15,454 --> 01:20:18,925
Look, just give us a chance.
I know she's green.

1170
01:20:18,926 --> 01:20:20,432
But she's... she's got a gift.

1171
01:20:20,433 --> 01:20:21,963
Whatever's wrong we can fix it.

1172
01:20:21,964 --> 01:20:23,793
<i>Yeah, that's not gonna
work for us.</i>

1173
01:20:26,264 --> 01:20:28,567
Is this because of me?

1174
01:20:31,172 --> 01:20:34,506
- Matt?
<i>- It's just a big risk.</i>

1175
01:20:34,507 --> 01:20:40,216
Matt, please. Don't do this.
Don't do this to her.

1176
01:20:41,817 --> 01:20:42,856
I'm begging you.

1177
01:20:46,284 --> 01:20:48,620
I... I can step away.

1178
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:52,459
I can take it.

1179
01:20:53,932 --> 01:20:55,257
Just don't do this
to my little girl.

1180
01:20:55,258 --> 01:20:56,360
Man, she's just a kid.

1181
01:20:56,361 --> 01:21:00,065
<i>David, it's business.
You know that.</i>

1182
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:02,304
<i>She may as well know it, too.</i>

1183
01:21:18,585 --> 01:21:20,117
<i>If you'd like to make a call,</i>

1184
01:21:20,118 --> 01:21:23,124
<i>hang up and try again.</i>

1185
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:25,626
<i>Hang up and then
dial your operator.</i>

1186
01:21:30,336 --> 01:21:31,597
David.

1187
01:23:07,965 --> 01:23:10,161
<i>Come on, Helen, it's time.</i>

1188
01:23:10,162 --> 01:23:11,828
<i>I'll call your brothers.</i>

1189
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:14,730
<i>We'll pool finances together
and cover the fares.</i>

1190
01:23:14,731 --> 01:23:17,270
David really wants to be there
to bury James,

1191
01:23:17,271 --> 01:23:19,908
so maybe
if you could just cover him.

1192
01:23:19,909 --> 01:23:23,205
<i>No, Helen, you all come home.</i>

1193
01:23:23,206 --> 01:23:24,710
<i>For good.</i>

1194
01:23:27,817 --> 01:23:28,678
<i>Come home.</i>

1195
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:31,424
- I'll call you back, Mum.
<i>- Helen...</i>

1196
01:23:51,169 --> 01:23:54,707
Mummy, I'm hungry.

1197
01:23:56,075 --> 01:23:57,314
Okay.

1198
01:23:59,848 --> 01:24:00,848
<i>David.</i>

1199
01:24:02,050 --> 01:24:03,389
There's no food.

1200
01:24:05,416 --> 01:24:07,324
And we're almost out of money.

1201
01:24:11,764 --> 01:24:13,396
What kind of man am I?

1202
01:24:18,298 --> 01:24:19,831
What kind of husband?

1203
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:22,504
Or father?

1204
01:24:24,807 --> 01:24:26,035
Or son?

1205
01:24:31,614 --> 01:24:34,681
I can't even bury my own dad.

1206
01:24:50,498 --> 01:24:53,764
Do you have an ace?
Go fish.

1207
01:24:53,765 --> 01:24:56,699
- Do you have a four?
- Kids, grab your jackets.

1208
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,402
Why?
Where're we going?

1209
01:24:58,403 --> 01:25:01,271
Out. Let's go, guys. Let's go.

1210
01:25:25,229 --> 01:25:26,297
Boys, not now.

1211
01:25:32,271 --> 01:25:34,140
Look, a playground!

1212
01:25:34,141 --> 01:25:36,044
Whoa!

1213
01:25:36,045 --> 01:25:37,913
Mum, can we pull over, please?

1214
01:25:37,914 --> 01:25:38,974
Mum, Mum, Mum, pull over.

1215
01:25:38,975 --> 01:25:42,419
- Please Mum! Please, Mum!
- Can we go, please, Mum?

1216
01:25:44,547 --> 01:25:46,549
All right, all right!

1217
01:25:52,259 --> 01:25:54,195
Go on, darling.

1218
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,601
All right, who's the captain?

1219
01:25:58,602 --> 01:25:59,565
Me!

1220
01:25:59,566 --> 01:26:01,234
Oh, we can't all be the captain!

1221
01:26:01,235 --> 01:26:02,667
- Starboard side!
- Look ahead!

1222
01:26:02,668 --> 01:26:04,570
I'm going down!

1223
01:26:04,571 --> 01:26:07,272
I need backup!
We've gotta take cover.

1224
01:26:07,273 --> 01:26:08,940
Mum, come on! Up here!

1225
01:26:10,508 --> 01:26:12,647
Fire as you bear!

1226
01:26:13,278 --> 01:26:14,415
Fire!

1227
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:16,144
- Fire at the...
- Four points to starboard!

1228
01:26:16,145 --> 01:26:19,153
- Uh, which way is that?
- Uh, right, right! I think.

1229
01:26:19,154 --> 01:26:20,789
There! There it is, there it is!

1230
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,886
What? Where?

1231
01:26:21,887 --> 01:26:24,521
The pirates' castle!
They're in there, over there!

1232
01:26:24,522 --> 01:26:26,755
I thought I smelled pirates.

1233
01:26:26,756 --> 01:26:28,392
What d'ya think,
Lieutenant Joshie?

1234
01:26:28,393 --> 01:26:30,428
- Let's get 'em.
- Yeah.

1235
01:26:30,429 --> 01:26:32,800
Fire when ready, Captain Benji.

1236
01:26:32,801 --> 01:26:34,263
Fire!

1237
01:26:34,264 --> 01:26:35,538
Fire!

1238
01:26:36,808 --> 01:26:37,903
Now what?

1239
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:40,636
Let's go!

1240
01:26:40,637 --> 01:26:43,409
Abandon! Abandon!

1241
01:26:48,348 --> 01:26:49,879
<i>All right, all right.</i>

1242
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,151
Before we attack,
who's got their torch?

1243
01:26:53,152 --> 01:26:54,183
I've got mine.

1244
01:26:56,688 --> 01:26:58,894
There's one thing left to do.

1245
01:26:58,895 --> 01:26:59,958
What? What is it?

1246
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:05,860
We burn the ships. All of them.

1247
01:27:05,861 --> 01:27:08,098
- Even ours?
- How do we get back?

1248
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:10,034
We don't.

1249
01:27:11,375 --> 01:27:14,713
It's gonna be dangerous
and scary,

1250
01:27:14,714 --> 01:27:16,643
and it's gonna be hard.

1251
01:27:16,644 --> 01:27:20,581
It's gonna be so hard
that you'll wanna go back.

1252
01:27:20,582 --> 01:27:25,484
But if you know that
you can go back, you will.

1253
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:32,393
And giving up, giving in,
it's not an option.

1254
01:27:32,394 --> 01:27:34,995
We've gotta
fight our way forward.

1255
01:27:34,996 --> 01:27:36,632
We have to win.

1256
01:27:38,134 --> 01:27:39,228
Do you understand?

1257
01:27:40,101 --> 01:27:41,164
Yeah.

1258
01:27:42,466 --> 01:27:43,804
Yeah.

1259
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:38,760
That's Bec's song.

1260
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,258
You wrote a song, Bec?

1261
01:28:44,266 --> 01:28:45,602
Can I hear it?

1262
01:29:25,804 --> 01:29:27,573
She wrote that.

1263
01:29:33,212 --> 01:29:35,850
Our kids have come all this way.

1264
01:29:38,618 --> 01:29:41,053
They gave up everything,

1265
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,255
and they're still happy.

1266
01:29:48,662 --> 01:29:51,030
Because they believe in us.

1267
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:54,066
And they believe in you.

1268
01:29:56,635 --> 01:29:59,137
They just believe.

1269
01:30:05,879 --> 01:30:08,113
It's time for you
to believe, too.

1270
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:11,622
Please.

1271
01:30:31,204 --> 01:30:32,841
Dad! Dad!

1272
01:30:37,113 --> 01:30:38,143
Boys...

1273
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:41,949
I've acted like a fool.

1274
01:30:44,222 --> 01:30:45,381
Can you forgive me?

1275
01:30:46,752 --> 01:30:48,186
Yeah, of course, Dad.

1276
01:30:49,226 --> 01:30:51,123
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1277
01:30:52,293 --> 01:30:53,389
Yeah.

1278
01:30:57,133 --> 01:30:58,262
Helen.

1279
01:31:12,214 --> 01:31:13,214
Becca...

1280
01:31:16,853 --> 01:31:20,383
I lost sight
of what it's all about...

1281
01:31:23,657 --> 01:31:25,289
of who it's all about.

1282
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:29,260
But you never did.

1283
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:34,969
You're a beautiful singer.

1284
01:31:40,205 --> 01:31:42,812
But you're an even
more beautiful person.

1285
01:31:46,849 --> 01:31:48,310
You don't have
to give music another go,

1286
01:31:48,311 --> 01:31:51,051
and you certainly don't have
to do it with me.

1287
01:31:55,425 --> 01:31:57,590
But I need you to know

1288
01:31:57,591 --> 01:31:59,895
that I'm honored to be your dad.

1289
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,536
And that I'm sorry.

1290
01:32:20,283 --> 01:32:21,554
I'm sorry.

1291
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,384
I, um...

1292
01:32:28,326 --> 01:32:30,420
I do wanna try again.

1293
01:32:31,827 --> 01:32:35,227
And even if you don't, um,
manage me,

1294
01:32:37,767 --> 01:32:39,836
it helps to have family
in your corner.

1295
01:32:41,504 --> 01:32:42,637
If I had it my way,

1296
01:32:42,638 --> 01:32:47,272
I'd have you all there,
all the time.

1297
01:32:50,407 --> 01:32:52,810
<i>Hello.</i>
Eddie DeGarmo,

1298
01:32:52,811 --> 01:32:56,112
David Smallbone. From Australia.

1299
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:58,587
<i>The David Smallbone
from Australia</i>

1300
01:32:58,588 --> 01:33:00,687
<i>is the only David Smallbone
I know.</i>

1301
01:33:17,737 --> 01:33:19,106
So hit rewind.

1302
01:33:20,481 --> 01:33:22,406
And that will take you
to your next clip.

1303
01:33:23,642 --> 01:33:25,109
Whoa!

1304
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:26,681
You're gonna sing harmonies
on the chorus,

1305
01:33:26,682 --> 01:33:29,182
and, uh, hey,
share this mic, right?

1306
01:33:29,848 --> 01:33:31,378
What? With Luke?

1307
01:33:31,379 --> 01:33:35,518
- Yeah, Joel, for Rebecca.
- And Jesus.

1308
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,589
When you put it like that.

1309
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:39,060
Good on ya, Joely.

1310
01:33:41,865 --> 01:33:44,065
Waiting in the wings
and stuck with you.

1311
01:33:44,797 --> 01:33:46,364
Story of my life.

1312
01:33:48,035 --> 01:33:50,738
Ah. Hey, Dad,
ready for sound check?

1313
01:33:50,739 --> 01:33:53,272
We're not gonna
use a track this time.

1314
01:33:53,881 --> 01:33:55,543
Why not?

1315
01:33:55,544 --> 01:33:57,276
You need to sing your own song.

1316
01:33:59,014 --> 01:34:02,880
Look, all this time,
I told you to trust me.

1317
01:34:02,881 --> 01:34:04,613
It's high time I trusted you.

1318
01:34:07,891 --> 01:34:11,455
Uh, I can't.
I've got no background music.

1319
01:34:12,363 --> 01:34:13,363
Yeah, you do.

1320
01:34:14,627 --> 01:34:16,130
I called for help.

1321
01:34:26,070 --> 01:34:27,471
Thank you.

1322
01:34:40,050 --> 01:34:41,892
Dad kept trying to tell me.

1323
01:34:43,527 --> 01:34:45,159
And I didn't listen.

1324
01:34:46,157 --> 01:34:48,063
Hey, he knew you loved him.

1325
01:34:48,597 --> 01:34:49,966
He knows still.

1326
01:34:50,832 --> 01:34:53,897
Oh, darl, I wasted so much time,

1327
01:34:53,898 --> 01:34:55,033
chasing so many things,

1328
01:34:55,034 --> 01:34:57,138
and you were right here
the whole time.

1329
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:02,077
I'm so sorry for missing you
and the kids.

1330
01:35:02,810 --> 01:35:05,113
And all the miracles.

1331
01:35:06,353 --> 01:35:08,515
But the greatest miracle is you.

1332
01:35:09,913 --> 01:35:11,350
That you love me.

1333
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:13,583
That you're still here.

1334
01:35:15,993 --> 01:35:20,656
Well, you promised adventure
and you delivered.

1335
01:35:32,369 --> 01:35:34,940
- Eddie. How you going?
- Good, man, good.

1336
01:35:34,941 --> 01:35:36,905
Producing partner here,
Greg Ham.

1337
01:35:36,906 --> 01:35:38,646
David Smallbone.

1338
01:35:38,647 --> 01:35:40,512
- A pleasure.
- Uh, shall we?

1339
01:35:40,513 --> 01:35:41,677
Please.

1340
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:51,390
Gentlemen,
without, uh, further ado,

1341
01:35:52,189 --> 01:35:54,195
Rebecca Jean Smallbone.

1342
01:39:17,732 --> 01:39:19,033
Wow.

1343
01:39:19,034 --> 01:39:21,800
Becca, that was, uh,
that was good.

1344
01:39:21,801 --> 01:39:23,902
Thank you, sir.

1345
01:39:23,903 --> 01:39:25,269
But gotta be honest.

1346
01:39:25,270 --> 01:39:27,771
Not just looking
for another voice.

1347
01:39:29,009 --> 01:39:31,175
I love to sing.

1348
01:39:31,176 --> 01:39:32,750
And, if it can help other people

1349
01:39:32,751 --> 01:39:36,989
find what God's given me
and my family,

1350
01:39:38,352 --> 01:39:40,883
then I'll do it,
with all my heart.

1351
01:39:53,864 --> 01:39:56,238
Well, Rebecca,
it pains me to say this

1352
01:39:56,239 --> 01:40:00,837
but, um, I'm gonna have
to look for someone else...

1353
01:40:04,110 --> 01:40:05,644
to clean my house.

1354
01:40:07,777 --> 01:40:09,951
Welcome to Forefront Records.

1355
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:14,752
Well done.

1356
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:18,255
Just, just one condition.

1357
01:40:18,256 --> 01:40:20,527
Yeah, no, I've got one as well.

1358
01:40:21,194 --> 01:40:23,431
Oh, well, ladies first.

1359
01:40:24,296 --> 01:40:26,698
I want Dad to manage me.

1360
01:40:29,206 --> 01:40:31,534
Done.
I thought that was a given.

1361
01:40:31,535 --> 01:40:33,639
He's the hardest-working guy
I know.

1362
01:40:35,473 --> 01:40:38,373
Now here's my stipulation.

1363
01:40:38,374 --> 01:40:41,014
It's the name, Smallbone.

1364
01:40:41,015 --> 01:40:42,648
Hey, what's the matter with it?

1365
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:46,619
All right. All right.

1366
01:40:48,753 --> 01:40:53,021
How you feel about
"Rebecca St. John"?

1367
01:40:55,959 --> 01:40:58,664
Well, you got something
better, I'm all ears.

1368
01:41:51,484 --> 01:41:53,182
- Love you.
- Love you.

1369
01:41:53,183 --> 01:41:54,987
Ready, Joshie?

1370
01:41:54,988 --> 01:41:57,119
I'm so proud of you.

1371
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,786
- Grandpa James would be, too.
- <i>Well, g'day, everyone.</i>

1372
01:41:58,787 --> 01:42:01,562
<i>It's, uh,
David Smallbone here...</i>

1373
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:03,392
You know, Bec...

1374
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:06,704
I always believed
that you could do

1375
01:42:06,705 --> 01:42:10,131
anything you set out to do.

1376
01:42:10,132 --> 01:42:13,343
And I knew that you could do it
without losing your soul.

1377
01:42:15,639 --> 01:42:17,611
And whatever your dream is,

1378
01:42:19,282 --> 01:42:20,911
I know you're going
to achieve it.

1379
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:25,421
My dream is to be like you.

1380
01:42:29,487 --> 01:42:31,658
It always has been.

1381
01:42:32,523 --> 01:42:34,430
You're my hero, Mum.

1382
01:42:39,096 --> 01:42:40,698
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1383
01:42:40,699 --> 01:42:46,107
please welcome, my big sister,
Rebecca St. James.
